BCC High School staff and students are proud to welcome the newest addition to our student body. Meet Danna Rodman Jonas, a sophomore who transferred into our school only days after the arrival of our new principal, Dr. Mooney. We’re happy to welcome Danna into our school, and hope you all do the very best you can to make her feel at home in this new environment! Danna has told us that she’s very excited that she’s going to be learning with all of you. As she told us yesterday, “It’s gonna be lit as awesome sauce, my dudes! I sure love watching The Office and playing computer games on my smartphone! But obviously not during class time though.”
