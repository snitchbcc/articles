In a stunning move yesterday, Lyudmila Autovich, driver of the 1123 bus, has asserted complete dictatorial power over the vehicle’s occupants after a year long campaign. This 57 year-old from Sauronastan is bringing a taste of the old country to BCC. In Sauronastan, Lyudmila was the Minister of Truth for government’s youth army corps before it was toppled by a NATO police action. After escaping custody en route to the Hague she came to the United States and took a job as a bus driver. Her first action as lead executive of the 1123 bus line was to crush opposition by forcing dissenters off the bus miles away from their homes.

“I was let off the bus at Union Station in DC one time after I opened a window without her permission. It took me six hours to find my way home,” said Timothy Black, on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.

Her next action was to plaster the bus with propaganda posters and offer a dropoff directly at your door for students who would inform on their seatmates.

At press time, several of our sources on the 1123 bus recanted their statements. Timothy Black was unable to be reached for comment. He was later found wandering around in central Wyoming.
