First there were tide pods, then there was vaping, but this wacky new trend that's working its way through the country is putting all the others to shame.

Started online by a group of mentally unstable Instagram influencers, this new trend has teenagers all over the country getting drunk out of their minds on absinthe, cutting off their left ear with a straight razor, and then sending it to a brothel in Arles.

You’re probably thinking “is it worth it to irreparably mutilate myself just to get a couple thousand Instagram followers?” Of course it is! Your body will continue to deteriorate through the years until you die as an emaciated husk, but the feeling of pure unadulterated joy from those thousand Instagram followers will carry with you into the next life, unlike the flesh vessel in which each of us lives!

But I understand the skepticism. I too was skeptical at first, until I tried it… and it was **AWESOME**. The outpouring of support I got after I completed the “Van Gogh” challenge was even more than the outpouring of blood from my severed left ear! I even got all my new Instagram followers to chip in for the $6,400 in medical bills my family had to pay! 

_The Snitch in no way advocates self mutilation, unless we can monetize it._
