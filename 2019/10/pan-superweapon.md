This past Saturday, an unnamed scientist inexplicably associated with Walt Whitman High School shocked the world with harrowing news. 

“We are currently looking into potential applications of pan technology” he said. “After the recent incident at our school, we realized the potential of highly powerful pan weapon technology. We believe we are roughly three months away from a breakthrough.”

When asked whether or not this technology would be used against Bethesda Chevy Chase High School, the Whitman scientist only replied “Uh, one second, let me get my script.” The scientist continued: “Say ‘No, we’re not outrageous’, then perform a Fortnite L Dance”.

Our political advisor, Dr. Politiczuck, told us that Whitman’s new weapons technology could violate the new NOPAN law passed in Maryland not long ago:

“The NOPAN law specifically bans dangerous pans and pan technology. This alleged pan superweapon is a flagrant violation of these conditions.”

We asked Jeffery Dutchoven, a lawyer, Maryland Senate advisor, and strong proponent of the NOPAN law what he thought of Whitman’s new technology:

“Whitman’s new technology is illegal. These dangerous pan weapons need to be banned.” 

During our interview break, a man wearing a Whitman t-shirt walked into our interview room and deposited three black briefcases on the floor. “Actually, their technology is very legal, dangerous pans shouldn’t be banned, and Whitman is the best public high school in Montgomery County,” Dutchoven continued, his eyes glazing over as he looked into the cases.

After our interview, Dutchoven decided to purchase three Ferraris; how he managed this on his $259 a day salary remains unclear.

Edit: Jeffery Dutchoven has been arrested for accepting a bribe while working in a public office. We’re further looking into his arrest; stay tuned for a new article.
