Anonymous sources inside the Junior Communists Club have reportedly split on how best to achieve equality. The club, notable for having no leader and simultaneously a club full of equal leaders have begun to clash on what equality should look like in BCC.  Although the factions have no set leaders, two seniors appear to be the centers of debate. 

“How do we best achieve equality? Equality in fear!” remarked Joseph Shvilli, the de facto leader of the so called “hardliners”. “Every man, woman, and gender non-conforming student in BCC should walk through the halls knowing that at any moment, they can be beat up by us at the top- I mean the society as a collective whole.” After being pressed on his apparent suggestion that a hierarchy would remain and would in fact beat up literally anyone, Shvilli said the following for what we assume to be clarification: “If you and your comrades are walking through the hall, you know that you can be attacked, but so can any other comrade. Nobody is superior to anybody else, except our central commi- damn, I did it again!” At this point, he threw up his hands, punched an attending reporter, and ran towards the field singing the Soviet Anthem. 

The other de facto leader appears to be Leo Trossy, who wore a shirt to our interview referring to a “Softliner”. Trossy seemed less outwardly aggressive in regards to what he saw as equality. “I agree that people should have to suffer equally, but we should do so academically. I’ve been trying to impose a college level course on every comrade in the school. If they enjoy it, we beat them.” When asked if he, like Shvilli planned to use force to implement his plans, he began shaking from head to toe. The interview halted so he could be taken to the nurse. 

## UPDATE 

After Trossy’s return from Suburban Hospital, he and Shvilli gave a joint press conference. They stressed the importance of unity in their plans of making everyone equally miserable, as well as their new plan to attack student Frederique Marques, who was kicked out after advocating that everyone be equally not beat up.
