Continuing their annual trend of Holiday disruption, the nation’s unstable Aunts have announced that they will be bringing their new Trump supporting boyfriends to Christmas dinner. The Aunts’ chosen spokesperson, Linda from your Mother’s side, has confirmed that her boyfriend of three weeks, Brian Tate, will indeed be joining your family for Christmas, and that he will be wearing a MAGA hat.  

Linda, along with several other “free spirited” Aunts at the press confrence have reaffirmed their commitment to giggle and jokingly slap their “Lock Her Up” T-Shirt wearing boyfriends when they bring up “those Chinese” or ask your lesbian cousin when she’ll “give all that up and get herself a man”. 

At press time the Nation’s Aunts have also announced that Mr. Tate will be bringing “Don’t Tread On Me” NRA car stickers for the family game of white elephant.
