Earlier today, 41 Republican congressmen led by Florida Representative Matt Gitz gathered outside Area 51’s gate and appeared to be preparing to storm the United States Air Force test and training range, which has long been believed to hold information on extraterrestrials. During preparations, Gitz gave an impromptu press conference; 

“I'm gathered here with dozens of my Congressional colleagues, outside of Area 51. Behind those doors is awesome alien shit they intend to keep to themselves. We want to know what is going on. It's only reasonable we would have questions like, are the aliens gray or green? How do they taste? Do they adhere to traditional Christian values? But so far the Air Force had refused to show us flying saucers and glowing stuff, saying that we “don’t have security clearance” or “are a bunch of idiotic assholes laying waste to the democratic system.” But I stand as an example for all those brave Americans undeterred by reason, ethics, or intelligence of any kind and with my fellow congressmen, in one unified voice, we demand to SEE DEM ALIENS!” 

At press time The Snitch had discovered many of the Congressmen already had security clearance, and more still were actually extraterrestrials themselves.
