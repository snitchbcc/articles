Hark! Earlier to day, it was told that the Snitche’s Managing Editor Bjorn Evermoor has been Cursed by a swamp Hagg for ever and ever! When sent to In-vestigate rumours of a noisome Witche who had sent rats and Vermin into our noble School, he angered her bye insulting her potion-brewing (which this crier would Nevere do as she is verily wonderful and he doth not want to be cursed) and she afflicted him with a Noxious and Horrible Hex. 

Truly, Bjorn shall never be the same. He stateth, “She doth say as folloes: All Managing Editors shall heretofore die in embarassing fashions!” Unfortunately for Him, he is a number one ye-olde-dorke, so who doth care? 

Since he had been Vexed already once, we sent Bjorn back to the Green Woman, who elaborated, “Leave or I shalt curse yer newspaper to be unfunnie forevermore!” Bjorn did stay a bit longer, but he found no new Information, nor did we notice a decline in the quality of our Writeing.

At time of the last cock’s Crowe, Bjorn was eaten by a Massive Wyrm, and did die most thoroughly and Humorouslie. The Snitche is currently negotiating to hire peasants of the House Levie to join as Managing Editores.
