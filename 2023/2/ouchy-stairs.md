Late this afternoon, a group of *Snitch* writers had a revelation: it is fun to write articles while walking or even running up and down flights of stairs. There are absolutely no risks involved, andâ€” AHHHHH! I am falling down the stairs! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ow!

Ouch! Ow! My body hurts so much! Ow! My poor, brittle bones! Ow! Oh no, I am going to hit that textbook someone left out! Ouch! I have hit it! Wow! These stairs are improbably long! Ouch! Oof! Owie!

Ouch! I have reached the bottom of the stairs, and certainly learned my lesson about them. Instead, I am going to write *Snitch* articles while driving!
