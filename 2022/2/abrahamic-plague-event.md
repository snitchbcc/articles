The Abrahamic God has announced that the new Plagues of Egypt remake will include a collaborative event with Zeus and Odin.

God kicked off the event with a throwback message via tumbleweed about His new collaborators:

“While we recognize that the alpha version of the Plagues remake, called COVID-19, was not up to the quality you expect from God, we are excited to announce that the new version will be more balanced. We are also excited to announce the inclusion of Odin and Zeus into the Plagues of Egypt, as I believe they have a lot to add. Zeus will act as the main antagonist of the game, adding his abilities to control lightning and storms to create a new twist on each and every plague. Odin will be the model of the main protagonist, bringing his extreme speed, his strength, and, most importantly, his ability to sleep on command.”

While the schedule of this new project is unknown, it promises to capture all the parts of the original that made it such an enduring and popular story.

As of press time, we’ve been told that the Plagues of Egypt remake will have a pre-order bonus, which will include a staff with the power to split water, among other unannounced bonuses.
