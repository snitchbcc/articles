In a move yesterday that many writers have decried, the MLA decided to ban adjectives. Yes, adjectives - those words which describe things - are no longer allowed to be used. A writer, feeling sorrow of a quantity that is at an increase when compared to the average, complained about this decision.

“I can’t believe the MLA would do this to us. I mean, it’s not like we did something that would warrant such punishment! We’ve been behaving in a manner in keeping with standards of goodness!” said the author, who spoke with loudness and concision so as to avoid adjectives. “How the fuck are we supposed to communicate ideas in a manner that contains brevity if we can’t even describe things?”

The MLA, however, defended their decision. “Writers were possessing complacency to a degree that is characteristic of largeness. Now, they’re being forced to think in a manner with some position in relation to the box while crafting their narratives.”

As of time, the MLA is looking to ban several parts of speech including the voice that contains activeness. The feelings we possess about this decision cannot be described.
