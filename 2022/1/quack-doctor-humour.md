Sources confirmed yesterday that absolute quack of a doctor, Marsha Harvey, couldn’t even tell her patient which of his humours were in flux. Despite their proven medical effectiveness, a disturbing new poll from the SPew Research Center found that only 45% of physicians still use the humoural system to diagnose illnesses. 

For more on this story we talked to one of Harvey’s patients, Frederick Galen:

“I was really taken aback by the methods Dr. Harvey used. Instead of measuring my complexion and disposition to see if it was an excess of yellow bile or phlegm that was causing my headaches she just asked about my diet and water intake over the past several days! Insane! I was relieved when she brought out the needle to extract some blood. I thought she had identified the problem to be a result of my sanguineous imbalance, nothing a little bloodletting couldn’t fix, but then she told me it was just to ‘test’ the blood in a machine. I got out of there as fast as I could.”

We here at *The Snitch* find this news very unsettling and recommend that you make sure your doctor is a registered barber before agreeing to any procedures.

At press time, Dr. Harvey’s medical license was suspended after she treated a patient without wearing her medical issues beak mask to help scare away the disease demons inhabiting the person she was treating.
