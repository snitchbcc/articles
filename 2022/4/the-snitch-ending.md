It is with great regret that we inform you of *The Snitch*’s current situation. For the past two months, we have been unable to pay our website dues, and our domain will be up for sale at the end of April. It’s been a wild journey, and we know losing *The Snitch* will leave an all-consuming void in all your hearts, as well as ours.

With that in mind, we would like to leave our last mark on the internet with some advice on how to proceed with the spring. Enjoy.
