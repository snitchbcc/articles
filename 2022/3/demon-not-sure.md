A local demon was reportedly not quite sure what they are supposed to do with the new born baby they acquired in a trade for an extra hour of sleep for the parents. The demon was seen hanging around the park with the young boy, whom they had acquired in a trade for an extra hour of sleep.

We sent managing editor Hudson Yon to the demon’s lair to ask why they had taken the child to the park:

“Well I don’t quite know what to do with a baby. It’s an important demon milestone to obtain a firstborn child, but no one ever talks about what happens afterwards. All these things do is shit and sleep; there is no cosmic power in them. But other people take their kids to the park, so I figured why not?”

The summons of a struggling Latin student forced them to fly off, but Hudson managed to track them down at their office in Hell (suffering only a few third degree burns) in an attempt to get them to weigh in on the #fathersongoals that had been circulating around the internet in reference to the two. However, he was unable to get an interview as the demon was busy trying to get the child to sleep while being berated by their boss over the phone from his house for not being available on their day off.

As of press time, the demon has called the child Aim.

*Editor's Note* Aim means “my beloved” in the Ars Goetia
