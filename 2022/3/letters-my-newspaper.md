series: Letters to the Editors
---

Despite the tragic banishment of former Editor in Chief Dale Bell, we’re still receiving copious amounts of mail from *The Snitch*’s dedicated readers, so we’ll be picking one message for this edition of **Letters to the Editors**. If you have any burning questions for us at *The Snitch*, send in mail for a chance to feature in our next article. Without further ado, here’s a random letter we’ll be responding to:

**Letter From Dale Bell:**

Dear Auguste and Caleb,

I just remembered this club existed and I checked in on some of the recent articles and I can’t help but notice that you two made a few changes since I’ve left. No, scratch that. It’s obvious that you’ve seriously screwed things up.

Your article titles are boring, your only series articles are Infonongraphic and Everyone’s A Critic, and only one person who you’ve recruited has really done anything. This is a textbook club disaster.

I expected *The Snitch* to decline in quality after I’d left, and I thought I was prepared. But holy shit, guys. What the actual hell have you done to my newspaper?! 

Sincerely,\
Dale

***Snitch***** Response:**

Hey, Dale. We love receiving fan mail from our followers, and it looks like your parents named you after our former Editor in Chief! How quaint! But just between us, we’re pretty sure Dale’s sense of humor was nonexistent, so we’re moving away from his managing style.

In any case, have you joined our Discord server? It’s the best way to keep in contact with us if you’re curious about how *The Snitch* functions. We’d love your crass writing on our website, so consider joining as a writer.
