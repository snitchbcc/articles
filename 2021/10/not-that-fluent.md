  Full Day

Yesterday, the B-CC World Languages Department collapsed into anarchy after the popular translator service Google Translate temporarily broke. The Google Translate outage left hundreds of students and teachers unable to maintain their bilingual facade. One administrator, attempting to calm down students, announced: “Do not panic. We will be able to continue our cultural learning. Or as they say in Spain, ‘no panicar! Son continuamos cultural learnendo.’ ”

Responses to this catastrophe were mixed. The French department, soon realizing their students’ total lack of ability to conjugate even the simplest of verbs, chose to teach the classic French art of being pretentious. The students are already successfully using this skill to make up for their monolingualism, with one saying, “onhonhon! J’e— Jerm— J’emape— I don’t have to remember how to say ‘my name is,’ I’m still more cultured than you!”

The Spanish students, meanwhile, remembering vaguely that Spain had some sort of vast empire, decided to conquer the C wing and establish the “República Independiente de la C,” which our Google Translate-avid foreign affairs expert says means “The Republic Independent of A The Is.” 

Chinese 1 unfortunately had a test today and saw a 100% failure rate, as well as the realization that most students could not read Chinese characters and were instead guessing meanings based on shape. A student we interviewed defended this strategy: “It hasn’t failed me yet! For example, this one looks kind of like a dress, so I know it means woman,” she said, pointing at the character for “wood.”

Currently, many students are looking for ways to salvage their quickly dropping grades. Possibilities include developing a fluency ray gun, elaborately cheating on every exam, or, most horrifying of all, actually learning to speak the languages they’ve been taking classes in for three years.
