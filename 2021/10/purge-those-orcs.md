Early this morning at a press conference held by Sir Leon of Bethesdica, an embarrassing gaffe revealed the knight’s lack of modern knowledge when he pledged to cleanse Sea-World of its “orcs.” This out-of-touch promise was made near the end of a seemingly unrelated speech about strategies to avoid the “New Black Death'' during a local Paladin’s Convention. A recording of the speech, captured by an inquisitive crusader, shows the mix-up in full.

“I hath received word,” bellowed Leon, “that the Worlde of Sea doth have many an orc hidden away!” The audience faltered, but he continued, yelling “Forsooth! In Addition, it is verily true that said green-skinned wretches are mistreated, forced to leap and swim for the public’s entertainment! And while they are my enemies, I cannot bear to see-eth them in captivity… so I shall free them, then engage in glorious battle, and — oh, shit. Seriously? Orcas? Sorry, hold on.”

The knight retreated at once from the podium, sheepishly scratching his head; his social media manager later stated it was “simply a Middle Aged moment” but that “Leon will be working to learn more about Sea World and the status of both orcs and orcas in captivity.” 

As of press time, Sir Leon has been provided with a copy of Free Willy, and will give a more formal apology after he figures out how to work the DVD player.
