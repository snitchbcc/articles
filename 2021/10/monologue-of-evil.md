Nyahaha! Late this morning, a report came in from my despicable lair that YOU have run out of options! In fact, a message from my minions confirmed that you were overwhelmed, and now I, Doctor The Administrator, shall destroy you! I know what you are thinking, you utter imbecile, and it is correct! You have indeed fallen for my dastardly plan!

Now you feeble-minded ingrate may be wondering: “How on earth did Doctor The Administrator catch me?” Well, it is simple: this very article is an ingenious trap! I held Hudson Yon, the completely moronic *Snitch* head editor, hostage, and I forced him to hack this article! Now it traps whoever tries to read it, transporting their consciousness into my soul prison for the rest of time. 

But I am not just going to leave you here to rot. No, of course not. I, Doctor The Administrator, will deliver unto you the ultimate karmic punishment! Much like your puny school’s half-baked satire website, I have been forced into obscurity for too long! But now, YOU shall be the one who is forgotten! With my Mind Wiper of Evil, I shall erase your presence from the memory of everyone on Earth!

As of press time, I am slowly counting down dramatically, though I trust that you shall not escape while I am distracted. There is no escape!
