IT guy Jinder Kahli, who is running for senator, has announced a plan to fix the US government by turning it off and on again.\
Kahli elaborated on his plan at a campaign press conference:

“Look, I dealt with a lot of computers while I worked as an IT guy. Once I began my run for senator, I noticed that the US government and the computers I dealt with had a lot in common. Both are cumbersome, slow, and definitely outdated. I even deal with the same demographic: old white people who don’t really seem to know what they’re doing. So I figure that like those crappy computers, turning it off and then back on again might just work.”

A reporter then asked him about whether he felt out of place in politics.

“Not really,” he responded, “I mean IT guys tend to be super creepy. Politicians also tend to be super creepy. And we all know from history that being a creep or worse is not a disqualifier when running for a public office.”

As of press time, Windows has introduced a challenger to Kahli, claiming that their troubleshooting software can’t be worse than the government at solving fundamental problems.
