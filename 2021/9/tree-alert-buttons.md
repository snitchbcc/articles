An innovative new company has created buttons that allow fallen trees to contact family members upon their fall and inevitable death. CEO Alastair Vega gave a statement about the new product in a press conference yesterday:

“We saw the success of Life Alert, and thought that one of the groups that is most in need of a similar product were trees. Many older trees are now considered fall risks by the EPA, and yet there is far too little awareness about this problem. One out of every 100 trees has had a relative fall in the past year, and most don’t even know about it until it is far too late.”

The product has already been sent to some trees in high risk areas such as the Amazon Rainforest. However, there was a problem with the initial shipment, as 30% of the alert buttons were found on the black market after the trees they were sent to had been cut down. These buttons are reportedly being used to fund the new Christ the Protector statue.

As of press time, several philosophers have ascended to a higher plane as they no longer have to ponder whether fallen trees make a sound if no one is around.
