Everyone knows that millennials suck at life. Many of the smartest minds across the country have seen the correlation between the increase in millennials and the decline of the many cornerstones of American life. Such cornerstones include, but are not limited to, the 9 to 5 workday, dinner dates, napkins, cruises, diamonds, relationships, gender roles, marriage, and running. A more comprehensive list can be found by entering “millennials are ruining” into your search engine.

However, the ruining of all that makes America great is nothing compared to millennials’ biggest failure. We here at *The Snitch* have scoured the globe hoping we were mistaken, but we were not. We’ve found concrete evidence and gathered various testimonials that have allowed us to positively conclude that not a single millennial has managed to reach the age of 50, an age renowned for its mix of wisdom and physical ability. The terrifying fact that millennials have not succeeded in reaching the fabled number further demonstrates that they have failed to amount to anything.

We can only hope that the dirty millennials’ successors, Gen Z, can model themselves after the generations of old by walking to school for 5 hours everyday, ruining the environment, and declaring war on Iraq.
