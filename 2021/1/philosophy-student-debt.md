Administration officials at Archmont College were aghast yesterday when recently graduated philosophy major, Mary Ann Evans, refused to acknowledge the one hundred and eighty-six thousand dollars that she owed in student debt, as the money was just a “societal construct.” 

Ms. Evans justified her position by explaining that money has no value beyond what society places on it, and that, as a philosophically matured person who refuses to participate in said society, she could not be beholden to its values and debts.

In response, Archmont College released a statement saying:

“We fully support our students in their endeavours to question the world around them. That being said, we *will* have our collection guys kneecap Ms. Evans if she doesn’t cough up the cash. We need a goddamn climbing wall.”

We also talked to Dr. Ellbogen Patches, a philosophy professor at Archmont College:

“I remember Ms. Evans well. She is a bright young woman.” Dr. Patches told us. “It’d be such a shame if something were to happen to her because of such a small issue as this. One of Ms. Evans’s favorite topics was Occam's Razor. If she is unable to resolve this tiny payment issue we may have to introduce her to a philosophical concept similar to Occam’s Razor: Igor’s Crowbar.”

At press time, Ms. Evans had agreed to work off her debt as an assistant professor to Dr. Patches and was on assignment acquainting some former art history majors with a relatively new philosophical concept, “Mary Ann’s Tire Iron.”
