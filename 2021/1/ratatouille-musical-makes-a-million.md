Subject: My Resignation

To God Emperor Dale and my esteemed colleagues,

I am sad to report that this email will act as my resignation. For over a year I have tried to bring the truth in as humorous a light as possible, but given recent developments I feel I am no longer able to do so. 

As is well known among staff, I am a theatre geek, so I was surprised and bewildered when Ratatouille: The TikTok Musical not only aired as a benefit concert for The Actors Fund, but raised over a million dollars. I was just not ready to see serious actors I loved in such a bizarre production. I am also concerned that a musical written by teenagers on TikTok, being sung by Tony winning stars, and making A MILLION DOLLARS will be more absurd than anything I will ever write. With this development, truth has become stranger than fiction, and any attempt to surpass this will be dangerous to my mental health.

I wish the best for each and every one of you, and of course for *The Snitch* as a whole.

(Former) Writer,\
Bill Angell

(P.S. If anyone catches me humming any part of that show youâ€™re allowed to slap me.)
