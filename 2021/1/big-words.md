It was confirmed by irrefutable sources in the little hours of yesterdayâ€™s morning that pretentious coxcomb Wilson Whitehurst wantonly employs sententious and turgid rhetoric during occurrences where it would be much more apt to select a less convoluted array of diction.

While Whitehurst fabricates a facade of gregariousness, this is but a ruse to entrap his interlocutor in a miasma of tortuous vocabulary in a futile effort to appear perspicacious. He floods any colloquy that he is a part of with a deluge of cerebral balderdash.

However, after vigorous scrutinization, it has been concluded that Whitehurst is nothing but a dim-witted ignoramus with a pocket thesaurus. In his attempt to masquerade as an erudite and urbane cavalier, he has instead shown himself to be a popinjay who is prone to unavailing histrionics.

At the time of the publication of this anecdote, Whitehurst had reportedly withdrawn to an intellectual symposium to avoid *Snitch* reporters.
