After an intensive hour-long meeting, the B-CC Administration released a statement acknowledging the problems with the current Baron mascot and announced that, effective immediately, B-CC’s mascot will be changed from the Barons to the Redskins. 

This move comes after pressure from students and faculty who believe that the baron lacks proper whimsy, as it is too accurate a representation of the average B-CC student. In an interview, B-CC PTA member Laura Kipling said the following:

“While the Redskins may not be the perfect replacement, I sure am happy they got rid of that awful baron. It may seem that quibbling over a ridiculous mascot is a massive waste of time and energy that could otherwise be devoted to more useful and immediate endeavours, such as addressing actual racism in the school, but we in the PTA would like to stress the importance of sitting still and looking busy to the established administrative system.” 

At press time, B-CC students and faculty rallied behind the new Redskins mascot and are now lobbying to change the school’s name as “Bethesda-Chevy Chase” has too privileged a connotation.
