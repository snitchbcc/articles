We’re introducing our newest one time advice column: **Why Don’t You Help Us For A Change**!

Yeah, that’s right. We’ve been helping you deal with your problems since we were founded, but what have **you** done for us? Nothing. Have you ever stopped to wonder whether **we** need advice? 

It’s not easy being the most prestigious publication in human, ant, and elephant history. The IRS is auditing the hell out of us, no doubt trying to get our tax exempt church status revoked. Also, our Managing Editor Caleb lost a bunch of his toes to trench foot after we sent him back in time to do an article on World War One. 

So yeah, that's what we’re dealing with. Did you ever even think to ask if we needed help? No! You’re just content with giving us more and more of your problems for our famous philosophers to answer… 

If you can summon the tiniest bit of empathy, join our Discord on the contact page and give us some advice.
