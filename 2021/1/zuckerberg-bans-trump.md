Late yesterday, in a press conference on the topic, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg laid out his reasoning behind issuing a permanent ban of Donald Trump’s Facebook account, saying that undermining democracy was *his* thing.

These moves come after Trump incited a riot where far-right protestors stormed the U.S. Capitol building, something that Zuckerberg said “is totally my thing.” He continued:

“Mr. Trump has severely overstepped his authority in eroding the democratic process. He's moving in on our turf and we don’t mess around. He needs to learn his place and leave destroying democracy to the pros.”

At press time, Zuckerberg was reportedly further infuriated when it came to light that Trump has a history of rating women based on their looks, something else that Zuckerberg says is also squarely in *his* domain.
