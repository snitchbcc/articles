Sources confirmed yesterday that local drunk Mark Clemens had completely misinterpreted the term “antibody cocktail,” and had shown up at a Regeneron distribution center hoping to get “absolutely wasted.” Clemens had first heard about the antibody cocktail on a local news report, and, having run low on his personal stock of booze, decided to try to get some more. 

When asked what he thought an antibody cocktail consisted of, Clemens responded:

“Well *hic* I can't remember the whole formula for *hic* the drink. I think I had it once in a *hic* club in Belgorod. It was *hic* vodka, absinthe, and Chechen tears. I *hic* woke up in a ice filled bathtub two weeks later with surgical scars *hic* and some weird tattoos. It was *hic* the best drink I ever had.”

Clemens has been joined by town drunks from across the nation after news of his story was circulated online. One of the first to join him was presidential lawyer Rudy Guiliani, who had broken out of his COVID ward after similarly misinterpreting the antibody cocktail as the Belgorodian drink.

At press time, Regeneron scientists told the crowd that while they were unable to give them the antibody cocktail they were looking for, they did have some experimental LSD. This offer was zealously accepted by the crowd.
