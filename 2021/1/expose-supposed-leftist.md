An anonymous tip the Snitch received last week claimed an alleged leftist refused to share a red crayon in kindergarten. Kenny Edwards, the leader of B-CC’s Young Communists Club, has vehemently denied the accusations, saying that all goods should be shared freely.

The B-CC administration launched an investigation, seeking witnesses to the alleged incident. The next day, the office was swamped with students who had witnessed the event. After several days of intensively questioning the students, who had surprisingly vivid memories, the administration concluded that Kenny had in fact refused to share his crayon.

The decision to move Kenny back to kindergarten was announced by Principal Mooney on Monday in a statement: 

“It is clear to the B-CC administration that Kenny failed to learn the important kindergarten lesson of ‘sharing is caring.’ Therefore, his parents and the administration decided he should be moved to a place where he can better learn that lesson, a kindergarten.”

As Kenny was removed from the school, witnesses claim he was muttering about the failure of communism and the plausibility of fascism as his next step towards self-fulfillment.
