Last week, Your Insecurities published a groundbreaking report stating that everyone in your class was in a group chat. Everyone except you. The news came just as you were trying to finish that APUSH essay, leading to an existential crisis that lasted several hours and ensured you got no work done.

When you pressed for the evidence that led to their conclusion, Your Insecurities cited two main points: 

“Firstly, you’ve noticed those little inside jokes that seemingly everyone else gets. You know, the ones that make you laugh awkwardly to feel like you fit in. Secondly, you’ve seen those memes your cool friend sends you about the group chat that doesn’t include the one annoying friend. Well does your class have two group chats? No? Case closed.”

When pressed about the possibility of a second group chat, your friend responded exactly as expected: “No of course not. Come on dude.”

*Exactly* what someone who is in a group chat without you would say.
