The U.S. passed a shocking milestone yesterday after it was revealed that the nation has been forced to dip into its strategic reserve of travel toothpastes after fully depleting the big toothpaste tube. This new development comes after an initial supply crisis was narrowly averted back in 2018 by rolling up the back of the tube to force more toothpaste out the top. 

For more on this issue we talked to Umberto Colgate, the new czar of the committee tasked with finding an adequate supply of those weird travel toothpastes from dopp kits around the house:

“Unfortunately many thought that the big tube was an infinite resource, like the cruelty of middle schoolers, but in fact, it was finite and had been decreasing rapidly for years, like the Amazon rainforest or the quality of *Simpsons* episodes. Now we’ve had to fall back on the strategic reserve of toothpastes we got during trips to the dentist.”

At press time Colgate and the rest of the committee had uncovered a much-needed stash of supplies after they opened a suitcase and found several travel toothpastes from the nation’s last trip to Europe.
