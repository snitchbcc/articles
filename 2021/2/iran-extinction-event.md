Could Iranian nuclear scientists be going the way of the dodo? Conservationists warn that the population of Iranian nuclear scientists has been decreasing at an alarming rate, possibly leading to their extinction by 2040. 

We interviewed conservationist Kenta Uemura about some of the worrying signs: “There has been a 10% decrease in the population of Iranian nuclear scientists in the past year, and the 2021 numbers already look like they will be similar. If this trend continues, the Iranian nuclear scientist will soon be endangered.”

We then asked Uemura about possible causes for this worrying decline. “As in many cases, this sudden decline in population was the result of the introduction of new predators. In this case, the apex predator is the CIA agent, although recent events have shown that an invasive species of Israeli assassins are also a threat.”

We can only hope that the Iranian Nuclear Scientist doesn’t end up like the near extinct species of Russian Opposition Leader.

As of press time, various sanctuaries have been proposed to keep the scientists safe. The current favorites are the Bat Cave, the Fortress of Solitude, or a neckbeard's basement.
