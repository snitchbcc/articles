Panic spread through the Pentagon yesterday after Chief Nuclear Strategist Milo Tappman suddenly remembered that the entire U.S. nuclear arsenal had run on Adobe Flash Player, a popular internet plug-in which recently went defunct.

“I mean jeez, we’re the U.S. Military, I thought we had some sort of backup plan for this. If the Chinese or the Russians hear about this we’re going to be a laughingstock, and they’ll also probably bomb us into the stone age,” wheezed Tappman while sprinting down a hallway to warn his superiors that the U.S. Nuclear Defense System had been crippled by the disappearance of the same software that ran such respected works as *Bloons* and *Kingdom Rush*.

“I knew we should never have left floppy discs!” shouted Nately Cathcart, Tappman’s supervisor. “Hell, we should never have left carrier pigeons!”

At press time, the crisis had been averted and the U.S. was once again safe from complete nuclear annihilation after Cathcart had gotten his teenage son Yossarian (a student in a local AP Comp Sci class) to code the arsenal a new platform on Scratch.
