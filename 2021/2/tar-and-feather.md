Chaos broke out yesterday at a small social gathering when IB Environmental Science student Jack Flint was tarred and feathered by a group of IB Physics students after complaining about how difficult his class was.

The altercation started when Flint complained about the studying he had to do for a test on soil erosion, saying:

“Man this test is so annoying. I had to study for like thirty minutes yesterday to memorize these terms. It’s so hard. I used to not understand all those IB jokes about having no social life, but after my first semester of Environmental Science I totally get it; it’s probably one of the hardest classes out there.”

Witnesses describe the room going completely quiet and everyone turning to a group of IB Physics students in the corner. The students slowly stood and began to methodically walk towards Flint while ripping open several pillows for feathers and gathering tar from an equally plausible source. Seeing the group’s intent, Flint rapidly tried to backtrack, saying:

“I mean we’re all IB right. You’ve got an IA; I’ve got an IA. At least I’m not an AP student complaining, right? Well I mean, I’m not a full diploma student but…”

At this, the Physics students lunged, dousing Flint in tar and covering him in feathers while screaming some incomprehensible nonsense about harmonic oscillation, Snell’s law, and the Higgs boson. After they were finished, they returned to their corner and resumed studying.

As of press time, Flint has transferred out of IB Environmental Science and has been tarred and feathered again, this time by his former IB Environmental Science classmates who were furious at his complaints about the difficulty of the IB Sports, Exercise, and Health Science class.
