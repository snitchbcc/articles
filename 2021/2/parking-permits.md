A few weeks ago, *Snitch* investigators uncovered a shocking conspiracy that implicates the entire administration, from Dr. Mooney to Dr. Mugerwa—a plot so astounding that we at first didn’t believe it. For the last 3 years, the administration has been using C-1 “student and visitor” parking permits instead of the required A-1 “administration and MCPS employee” permits for their cocaine and heroin drug smuggling operation.

This is appalling—the very people who have taught us to act morally, ethically, and responsibly turn around and, without a hint of shame, misuse MCPS parking permits.

We interviewed an anonymous source deep within the administration, Mr. Hargrave, who contacted us after being threatened, presumably for accidentally stumbling upon the administration’s plans to park incorrectly: “I first learned about their disgusting operation in May 2019. I was walking behind the school when I saw someone pulling out baggies full of white dust out of an administrator’s car. I walked up closer to inspect the vehicle and it confirmed what I thought I had seen...”

Before our anonymous source could finish his sentence, two suited men walked into the room and dragged him out. We sent Caleb, our Managing Editor, to contact our source again, but he was unsuccessful. We found Caleb alive in the trunk of a permitless car in the B-CC parking lot a few days later.

As of press time, we’ve contacted the Montgomery County Police Department and provided them with the evidence we uncovered, but they’ve refused to open an investigation into the admin’s egregious acts, and have instead begun looking into another crime that the administration allegedly committed. We at *The Snitch* deplore this decision as no crime could be worse than parking incorrectly at B-CC.
