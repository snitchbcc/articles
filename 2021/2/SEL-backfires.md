In a shocking turn of events that experts are calling “humorously ironic,” it appears that the recent Social-Emotional Learning has been *too* effective after newly emotionally intelligent students all across MCPS realized that their relationship with schoolwork was toxic and so cut it out of their lives.

We spoke with one student, Alan Brin, as he marveled at the beauty of the natural world:

“The snow glistening on the grass, was it always this beautiful? I never noticed it before; I was always too buried in those infernal books, but after that SEL seminar I was finally able to see my relationship with homework for what it was: toxic. I had to do work even though I didn’t want to. I was so trapped in that world of deadlines and grades that I didn’t realize that all I had to do to be emotionally fulfilled was completely stop doing work. Now I must go and immerse myself in that babbling stream. I must feel the world authentically, without toxicity.”

Unfortunately, temperatures were well below freezing and Brin got hypothermia almost immediately after throwing himself into the stream. Even more unfortunate, the ambulance driver had also seen the SEL video on his son’s computer, identified his relationship with driving ambulances to be toxic, and had decided to go skydiving.

At press time, MCPS was frantically backpedaling after realizing their mistake; sources confirmed that they will be producing a new video to counter the previous one called “Toxicity: Why Sometimes You Just Gotta Suck It Up And Do Work.”
