Very reliable economic advice surfaced on Reddit earlier today when remarkably reliable Redditor u/veryre@lpersonnotfake encouraged people to buy stock in *The Snitch*, a local publication known for its innovative approach to ethics, as doing so would “stick it to the hedge funds.” Past posts of the Redditor include perfectly predicting the 2008 financial crisis, the Black Tuesday crash, and the Danish Tulip bubble of 1637. We traced the account to an email under the name Auguste R. Unfortunately, this proved to be an unsolvable puzzle, so we gave up.

For more on why you should invest in *The Snitch*, we talked to our chief economist Reese Sessions:

“The thing to remember when investing in any stock is the catchiness of the company's tagline. *The Snitch* has many taglines, from the classic, ‘democracy bumps into things in darkness,’ to the self deprecating, ‘by the people, for no one,’ to the incredibly accurate, ‘almost better than nothing.’ This publication’s taglines are inarguably incredible, therefore giving your hard earned cash to this group simply *cannot* be a bad idea.”

At press time, *The Snitch* has finally moved googling “conflict of interest” to the “almost on the agenda” list.
