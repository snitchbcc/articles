In an industry meeting held yesterday, Apple CEO Tim Cook unexpectedly announced that nothing actually happens when you click on the “Keynote” application because they assumed no one would ever use it. The meeting, which employed a helpful Google Slides presentation for visuals, explained that during the development of the iWork Apple suite they decided to cut costs by never actually developing the Keynote application.

This bold strategy seemed to have paid off until a couple days ago when a new Mac user posted a question on multiple forums asking what Keynote was. For more on this story we spoke to that user, Neil Ellison, about how he discovered this:

“So I was going to click on iTunes, but my hand slipped, and I accidentally clicked the Keynote icon instead. It was some weird podium, I think? Anyway, I got ready to close it, but nothing happened. So I did some research and it turned out that no one seemed to know what Keynote was. I even looked at a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet showing percent usage of the iWork suite and Keynote wasn’t even on it.”

As shocking as this story is, preliminary reports seem to show that the situation has made no dent in the unbearable smugness of Mac users, with many users even praising the “avant garde-ness” of having an application that does nothing. 

As of press time, Google hit back by releasing information showing that nothing happens when you click on Google Duo, along with a statement saying, “Don’t trust us? Try it.”
