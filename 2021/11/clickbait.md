Hey, you. Yeah, you, the person reading this. Can I just say thank you? Listen, it’s been a long week. I’m tired, you’re tired. We’ve only gotten a few article clicks this week, and the senior writer says I don’t get paid if we don’t reach 100. So thank you for clicking this. Also, can you pretend we said something really controversial?

That’s right, I’ll even give you some suggestions. “Cops Have Never Done Anything Wrong” or “Wet Socks Are The Best” or how about “The MCPS Administration Is Competent And Efficient.” Yeah, those are pretty rage-inducing. Feel free to email us saying how angry you are and how you clicked on the article and sent it to all your friends.

I know we don’t have a comment section (presumably to avoid the floods of fanmail), but a strongly worded letter might be nice. Maybe you could even click one of our other articles? I don’t know. 

Thanks, man, that’s all I needed. You just prevented me from starving to death... for this week, anyway.
