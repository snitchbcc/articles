Quantitative literacy teacher Ms. Pauline Arbol was suspended today pending the completion of a B-CC administration investigation regarding allegations that Arbol was just making her quant lit students do her taxes.

*Snitch* reporters obtained one of the first word problems Arbol distributed at the start of the school year, which regarded the mathematics of saving and investing:

“A 36 year old single-income-no-kids female teacher living in Arlington, Virginia and working in Montgomery County, Maryland makes $72,639 per year. How much should she pay in state income tax in Maryland and Virginia? In federal income tax? Also, should she file Form 505 or Form 515 when paying her Maryland taxes? Finally, define ‘AGI factor’ and ‘Maryland Schedule K-1.’”

We also interviewed one of Arbol’s students, Wade Sheldon, regarding his teacher’s alleged misbehavior:

“I mean, we didn’t think anything of it at first — maybe Ms. A was just using oddly specific case studies. When she asked us to find her a one-bedroom home she could afford to buy on Redfin, preferably pre-furnished and in the Arlington area, we started to get a little suspicious. I think she crossed the line when she told us our first quiz would either be going to an IRS location to get tax assistance, visiting open-houses in Arlington, or attending her drunk driving hearing to testify about her character.”

As of press time, Arbol maintains her innocence.
