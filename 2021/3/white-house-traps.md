Last week the Biden transition team reported the discovery of a series of increasingly elaborate “Home Alone” style traps left by the Trump Administration in the White House in the days leading up to the transition of power. We sent Snitch field reporter Caleb Levy to learn more about the situation. 

After barely surviving one of the remaining traps, which involved fire, and some suspicious smelling smoke in Don Jr.’s room, Caleb was able to obtain an interview with the head of the transition team Mike McIntyre:

“The first trap we discovered came directly from the movie ‘Home Alone.’ When President Biden and his family visited the White House for the first time, one of his grandchildren slipped on the stairs, which were covered in ice. The team also discovered that the East Wing was full of Eric’s toy trains that were intended to once again trip the new president. After a couple hours of this, we started to notice a pattern. Each successive trap was something Former President Donald J. Trump is scared of; there were weaponized figurines of armed minorities and women’s rights posters waiting to harm the First Family. It got to the point where we were expecting a tax collector in a horror movie-esque mask to jump out at us.”

Trump has denied any knowledge of the traps, but his protests were about as believable as the premise of the movies the traps are based on.

As of press time, the traps have been condemned as “childish” by President Biden, Vice President Harris, and a literal five year old.
