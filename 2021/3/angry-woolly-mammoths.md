Saying that it was “totally alright” that scientists had decided to prioritize cloning the Black-Footed Ferret, the ghost of a Woolly Mammoth released a statement yesterday detailing how “super cool” it was to see scientists making strides in cloning threatened animals.

“It really is just so awesome to see scientists clone an extinct, I mean *endangered*, species,” starts the statement, delivered to the scientists by a self proclaimed animal medium. It continues: “But yeah, I’m so happy for the Black-Footed Ferret. It’s really great. I remember all the talk about bringing me back, but no one gives a damn about the Woolly Mammoth anymore! Nah I’m just kidding, no hard feelings at all! But seriously, bring me back to life.” 

The statement from the Mammoth was followed by messages from several other extinct species, including the Dodo, Saber-toothed Tiger, and several dinosaurs, all offering their congratulations to the Black-Footed Ferret.

At press time, the mediums overheard an agreement between the extinct animals to go “100% Jurassic Park on their asses” as vengeance for being “chosen after a glorified rat.”
