This weekend, during the Zoological Society of Continental Australia’s annual Bio-Conference, an anonymous naturalist stepped forward, admitting that the platypus was an extended hoax. According to our source, the concept of the platypus was conceived as a practical joke — one that the country’s naturalists are now too embarrassed to own up to. The statement begins as follows:

“For too long, we as an organization have been living a lie. In 1798, my ancestor, Captain John Hunter, sent a fake pelt and a letter back to Great Britain as a joke. He figured they would believe anything — hell, he was considering adding glitter glue — and he was right.” 

This revelation forces natural scientists around the world to reconsider the validity of thousands of Australian finds, as well as the greater position of monotremes in the tree of life. The statement continues:

“In the beginning it was easy, but after that upstart Darwin introduced more serious taxonomy, we thought we were screwed. It was only through the last-minute invention of the echidna that we could keep our lie going. Over the years, it snowballed — we made up more and more ridiculous facts: they laid eggs, they had venomous spurs, they sweated milk — but I knew we had gone too far when, in 2019, we developed two animatronic platypi and sent them to San Diego. We needed to in order to quell suspicion about the fact that they had been hitherto unknown in non-Aussie zoos. I’ve been drafting this statement for two years, because I knew I had to do *something*. I don’t know if the field of zoology can recover from this, but we have to stop it before it goes any further.”

As of press time, the scientific community has turned their scrutiny to the equally implausible reticulated giraffe.
