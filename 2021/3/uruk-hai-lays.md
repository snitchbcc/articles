Vowing not to be left behind in the newest trend of creating chip flavors based on non-existent creatures, Lays executives announced in a press conference that they would be moving a new *The Lord of the Rings* Uruk-Hai flavored chip into production.

“We’ll be completely honest.” Lays executive Chip Samson told us in an exclusive interview, “we were caught off guard by Pringles’ new ‘Mao Burger’ flavor based on the space Ostrich from Halo. But we refuse to be outdone, so now in partnership with J.R.R. Tolkien’s estate we will be producing a delicious new Lay’s flavor based on the beloved Uruk-Hai orcs, bred in the dark mud pits of Isengard and used to overwhelm and slaughter the armies of man at Helm’s Deep. To get as close to the canonical orc flavor as possible, we’re working with a team of top notch scientists who also happen to be Tolkien nerds. Probably a coincidence.”

Although the reviews of the flavor have been mixed, even the negative ones note the commitment lore that the chips embody.

“I personally am a Lord of the Rings fan,” Hamnet Gardener, an online food critic, told us, “and I can remember the first time we see an Uruk in the movie. He’s just been birthed from the mud pits and, in a murderous rage, he strangles his creator. I gotta say, this chip really captures that flavor exquisitely; I really felt like *I* was being strangled by an abominable crime against nature, and I guess in a way I was.”

At press time, many are saying that this new craze may have gotten out of control as Utz announced they will be making a Shai-Hulud sandworm flavor in partnership with Frank Herbert’s estate.
