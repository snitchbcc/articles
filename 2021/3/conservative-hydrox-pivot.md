After a weeklong market research meeting that ended yesterday, a spokesperson for Oreos’ competitor Hydrox announced that, to fill the void left by Oreos in the conservative cookie market, they would be rebranding as “THE ULTIMATE MASCULINE GENDER CONFORMING CRÉME COOKIES.” This comes after Oreos enraged social conservatives by changing the filling color of their cookies from white to rainbow in a show of support for the LGBTQIA+ community. 

For more on this story, we sent *Snitch* reporter Caleb Levy into the wild to find Hydrox’s headquarters, which had become so neglected it was reclaimed by nature, and had been enveloped by a small rainforest in the late 1990s. After fighting off a jaguar and licking a frog that may have been hallucinogenic, Caleb finally found Hydrox’s headquarters where he got Chief Marketing Officer, Benedict Crusoe, to agree to an interview by offering to share the frog.

“Now we’ve been out of the game for a while, but when we saw that Oreos had picked a side in the culture war we knew what we had to do. This rebrand is going to bring us back to the top, we’re going to be like Pepsi to Oreos’ Coke, except in our ad, instead of solving racism with Pepsi, the police beat the shit out of the protesters and then eat some Hydrox. Everything about our company has become more masculine, we’ve imprinted the bald eagle on every cookie, we’ve cut the créme filling with sand cause **real men** like grit, and every 100th package you buy now comes with an assault rifle.”

We also talked to one of the conservative groups organizing a boycott of Oreos, Five Moms and Fifteen Thousand Russian Trolls.

“It’s our duty as good Christians to protect the American way of life,” Elizabeth Fletcher, one of the five angry Moms told us, “To stop the rise of this immorality, we’ve banded together and boycotted Oreos and associated brands and companies that support this sinfulness. Unfortunately, due to corporate consolidation we’ve had to boycott every major food brand, and now we can only eat Hydrox and squirrel meat.”

At press time, *Snitch* lawyers had confirmed that every single brand mentioned in this article is preparing a massive lawsuit against us and had issued us a statement saying “we’re going to mash your bones into dust, mix em with the horse bones, add in a thickening agent, and turn you into the créme we use to fill our cookies.”
