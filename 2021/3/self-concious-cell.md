Feeling very uncomfortable about the new additions to its membrane, sources confirmed yesterday that a self-conscious adipose cell was reportedly wondering if its new membrane lipids made it look fat. 

“I always feel so nervous after getting a new bunch of glycerides,” the adipose cell told *Snitch* reporter Caleb Levy after we shrunk him down *Fantastic Voyage* style. “Everyone around here is always so judgy. The leukocytes are all ripped, and I think I heard one of them making fun of me with a neuron the other day.”

We also talked to Dr. Maria Coates, a professor of cell psychology at Fälschung University:

“We often underestimate how complex our cells are. In research that I’ve conducted, I’ve discovered that our cells in fact have thoughts, feelings, and a stratified social structure on the same level as that of a pack of baboons. Or a high school.”

Unfortunately, our interview was cut short when a group of researchers took her back to an experimental LSD study that she was a participant in.

At press time, the issue was resolved when the adipose cell got several new carbohydrate chains which are apparently “all the rage” these days.
