*The Snitch* continues its Order of Lenin winning journalism with a poignant new investigation into whether your mic was on for that. The answer: “oh shit was it?!?” I mean we think it wasn’t, but someone was talking and then they stopped talking, does that mean they heard you? Oh man this is so stressful, you were unmuted earlier when the teacher called on you, you could’ve just left the mic on. Did you remember to turn it off? 

This is so embarrassing. Should you say something? Like, acknowledge it, or just pretend it didn’t happen? Because we’re pretty sure it actually happened. Ok well the acceptable amount of time to acknowledge just ended, the teacher’s talking again. Oh god this is so humiliating, we bet everyone is laughing at you behind those black boxes. Well you’ll know for sure when the teacher posts the recording of the Zoom. When is that going to be? Is it right after class? Or is it at the end of the day?

Wait, we’re pretty sure the teacher just called your name to answer a question. Oh no, you haven’t been listening this whole time because you were stressing about your mic. What class even is this. Oh man the silence just keeps getting deeper. Oh shit.
