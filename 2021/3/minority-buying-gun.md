Earlier this week, a video surfaced on Twitter of a minority purchasing a pistol at a Walmart in Florida, causing an outpouring of outrage from conservatives nationwide. Polling in the aftermath of the video of the dangerous incident indicates that 100% of conservatives now support gun control, a stark change also supported by increased pressure on Congress to pass new “common-sense gun legislation.”

We talked to an anonymous source and leader of a Christian Anglo-Saxon fundamentalist group Thome Robinette about the proposed legislation:

“This legislation will prevent those ‘shady types’ from obtaining guns by limiting gun buyers to people 40 years and older with awful goatees who pretend to be military because they’re too weak to actually sacrifice their lives for their country. The legislation will also ensure that applicants are qualified enough to carry firearms by introducing new ‘eligibility tests’ with questions such as ‘do you use your god to shield you from your crimes’ and ‘do you plan on overthrowing the United States government with the help of firearms,’ all of which need to be answered ‘yes’ for the applicant to qualify.”

Many people were concerned that this new law was blatantly discriminatory. We talked with NAACP representative Will Jones about those concerns:

“All Americans, regardless of race, sexual orientation, or sexual identity should have the right to go to a Walmart, buy a semiautomatic assault rifle, tactical gear, CS gas, and zip ties, then drive to the US Capitol and attempt to overthrow the American government under the false pretense of election fraud.“

As of press time, Republicans have realized that their proposed laws are too extreme and have instead pivoted to helping pass Democratic legislation that requires that a potential gun owner have at least 250 hours of training before purchasing or owning a firearm.
