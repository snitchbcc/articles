In the wake of Netflix’s recent crackdown on password sharing, the streaming giant released an announcement that they had always thought that one account for all of North America was a bit suspicious, but that they had trusted that their clients wouldn’t abuse the system by password sharing. 

For more on this story, we talked to Netflix spokesperson Omar Reed as his faith in human honesty began to implode right before our eyes.

“I mean it crossed our minds that password sharing could have been happening, especially when we started winning all those awards but our subscribers remained steady at one account. But Americans are honest people and they’ll want to do right by us! To increase our presence, we spent 17.3 billion dollars in 2020, but our U.S. revenue kept steady at $18 per month no matter how much we spent on new content or advertising. Now I don’t want to cast any aspersions on our client, but I just don’t see how he can watch thousands of TV shows simultaneously while in millions of different places every day, it just doesn't make sense! Unless… Unless...”

Reed’s posture shifted as, in an epic feat of cognitive dissonance, he tried to reconcile facts with his belief in the essential goodness in human nature. While Reed struggled with his philosophical armageddon, *Snitch* reporters took a water break. On returning, Reed’s face had contorted into a look of such immense desolation which quickly morphed into a fiery rage as he fixed us with a soul-crushing stare:

“YOU BASTARDS! You are password sharing! I knew it! I goddamn knew it! Oh god, was that email from that Nigerian prince a lie too?! IT’S ALL LIES!!!!”

At press time Reed quit his job at Netflix and became a supervillain, hell-bent on bringing those password sharers who had destroyed his life to justice. Starting with **you**.
