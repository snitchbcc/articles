Texas Governor Greg Abbot declared a state of emergency for the state of Texas this past week in the wake of all the Sweet Tea in the state becoming iced due to the 4 inches of snow that decimated the second biggest state in the United States. 

The majority of Texas residents viewed the declaration positively. One Texan on Twitter claimed that Texas Style Sweet Tea™ is “as important to Texan culture as cowboy hats, high school football, and enough guns to stage that military coup everyone talks about but never actually does.”

Another Texan proclaimed that “The storm has been hard on all of us. Some of us have lost businesses, jobs, loved ones and/or friends. However our biggest trial, the loss of our Texas Style Sweet Tea™, is only just beginning. God bless Texas¨

As of press time, several new country songs have been written about the loss of the tea, such as hit single “First My Girlfriend Left Me, Then My Texas Style Sweet Tea™”
