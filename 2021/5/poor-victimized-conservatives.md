Saying that the culture at B-CC routinely silenced conservative opinions, several conservatives took to a widely circulated local newspaper yesterday to loudly decry the constraints on the expression of their views in a prominently placed three page op-ed.

“B-CC, and really the whole Bethesda area, isn’t an accepting place for us to express our views. In fact, we’re often silenced, unable to find institutions willing to publish our opinions such as how any form of background checks would basically ban all guns,” read a massive block quote on the second page of the op-ed, surrounded by enticing graphics and eye-catching formatting.

The editorial continued:

“Liberals often throw around the word equality, but where’s the equality for people who want to take equality away from other people? Is that equality? I didn’t think so. We need to address this issue head on: think about conservatives you know; don’t you start to see a pattern? They’re all timid souls afraid to speak their minds, it’s positively Orwellian!”

The article continued with a striking infographic outlining many key conservative issues that are perpetually suppressed by the liberal media and bemoaning how no one would ever know what these issues were…

The article ended on somber note, decrying the “wokeness” machine that forced poor conservatives to treat transgender people with basic human decency or spend their non-existent tax dollars on such liberal sinkholes as public education.
