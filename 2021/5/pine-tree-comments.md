B-CC administrators have been reeling recently after some old tweets of the Pine Tree resurfaced in which the tree was denigrating Poplars. Almost immediately, #PineTreeIsOverParty was trending on Twitter with other marginalized trees such as the Florida Yew and The Monkey Puzzle Tree showing their support. We interviewed Dr. Mooney to get his thoughts on the Pine's tweets:

“We are taking these new tweets very seriously. B-CC does not condone the tweets made by the Pine and we are very disappointed to learn of their existence. There is no place for those types of baseless comments in the B-CC community.”

The Pine Tree has also released a public statement on Twitter in order to defend itself:

“This is the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do. Those tweets do not represent me as a person. I am very sorry if anyone was offended by those tweets. I will try to do better in the future.”

As of press time, Maryland Republicans have tried to rally support for the Pine Tree to oppose Jamie Raskin in the 2022 midterm elections.
