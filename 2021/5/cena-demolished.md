Five days ago, beloved wrestler John Cena was absolutely squashed by China using a massive pile of money.

The feud started when John Cena added a sixth move of doom that followed the Attitude Adjustment: calling Taiwan a country. However his victory was short-lived as the lights went out, only to reveal China immediately challenging Cena to a match.

Calling Taiwan a country had left China visibly injured before the match even started, but China managed to rally quickly. The match ended quickly as China introduced a foreign object, a massive bag full of Yuans. After managing to distract the referee, China quickly forced Cena to submit under the wrath of the bags of money, in the quickest defeat Cena has suffered since facing the Undertaker at Wrestlemania 34.

As of press time, Cena and China are scheduled to meet in a No Holds-Barred match this Friday after Cena referenced the Tiananmen Square Massacre in a promo.
