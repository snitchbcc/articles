In an event that witnesses are calling “supremely bogus,” sources confirmed earlier this morning that the deceptively short AP Stat homework was actually full of subquestions, making it immeasurably long and time consuming.

“I remember it like it was earlier today,” said Thomas Helman, a student in the class, “we had just gotten the homework assignment and I was like ‘shit, three problems? Hell yeah.’ But when I opened the textbook Sunday at 11:30 PM, I saw that each of the problems had five, maybe six, subquestions! It was annoying because I had to keep flipping from the answers in the back to make sure I was copying from the right question. What a pain in the ass.”

Helman was not alone in his feeling of betrayal. A recent study found that feelings of disappointment experienced by students upon seeing an “a, b, c, d, e, etc.” on a supposedly short homework was rivaled only by getting a substitute who knows what they’re doing.
