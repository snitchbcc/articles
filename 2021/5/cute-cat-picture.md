Earlier this week, a picture of a cat receiving very good head scratches was posted on the r/cats subreddit by internet user TurkeyKing354657687 and exploded in popularity, continuing the tradition of cute pictures on the internet detracting from the slaughter of innocent women and children by the Saudis in Yemen fueled by American and Australian weapons.

We interviewed TurkeyKing about his cat Joey and their newfound fame: “Yeah, I guess I just took a picture of Joey one day and it turned out very well, so I decided to post it on Reddit. I’m just so glad my post will help thousands more Americans forget about how their taxes are funding an autocratic regime in the Middle East that seeks to destroy revolutionary groups in Yemen in violation of every single international law imaginable.”

As of press time, a new trending picture of a ferret wearing a frog hat has now infused thousands more with amnesia, this time as to the ongoing state-sponsored tribal terrorism of local villagers in Afghanistan.
