Calling it a prime example of the ineffectiveness of vaccines, several anti-vax groups slammed the COVID-19 vaccines yesterday after a fully vaccinated man died following being hit by a train. 

“Scientists would have you believe that vaccines are a silver bullet, but this shows that this just isn’t the case. The only real silver bullet out there is Jesus, and of course actual silver bullets, but they’re only good for vampires [sic]” said Meredith Edy, a leading anti-vaxxer and the self proclaimed ‘Superspreader of Truth.’ She continued: 

“My sources have confirmed that just two hours ago a man who was FULLY vaccinated DIED after being run over by a train! Now tell me if I’m wrong,” she said, speaking over our correspondent who was telling her she was wrong, “but isn’t a vaccine supposed to keep you from dying?! This incident just proves that vaccines are completely ineffective against 20,000 tons of steel, and if they’re ineffective against that, what else are they ineffective against?! Probably COVID!”

At press time, a group of exhausted scientists released a statement saying that the vaccine does not make you invincible, it just reduces your chances of dying from COVID. They also noted that silver bullets are ineffective against vampires and suggested garlic instead. Unfortunately, Edy and her group were unable to reply after several of them came down with measles.
