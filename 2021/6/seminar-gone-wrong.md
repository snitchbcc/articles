Late yesterday, sources confirmed that at least three sophomores in an Honors English 10 class have been hospitalized for hemlock poisoning after a Socratic seminar. The activity, named for the famed philosopher Socrates, became a little bit too authentic as the spirited debaters channeled their Athenian precursors to an unhealthy level.

For more information on this story, we talked to the teacher of the class, Mr. Krakauer, who is currently in close competition with Mr. Kent of the math department to win the moniker “Mr. K.”

“I like to do simulations in my class; they really involve my students in the material. It’s what I do. I’m a fun teacher. Although I’m apparently not fun enough to beat that buttoned-up calculator jockey Mr. Kent,” Mr. Krakauer told us as he flipped his baseball cap backward and moved conspicuously to show his Xbox 360 in the background of his Zoom. He continued: “I was really going to clutch the ‘Mr. K’ nomination with that simulation, but I knew I’d overdone it when things started getting mean. It devolved into brutal ad hominem attacks, threats of exile, and rampant corruption almost immediately, which is on-brand for ancient Athens but was not really what I was trying to impart.”

Sources from inside the class say that even the most innocuous comment was made into a punishable offense as populist factions emerged from breakout groups. The assigned skits were repurposed as vicious lampoons of other faction’s leaders while one unaffiliated student is reported to have presented a plucked chicken to the camera and screamed that he had brought a man.

The drama came to a head when, after a particularly ferocious skit, three students were ostracized from the group after having channeled Socrates during an argument. These same three were later admitted to a hospital for mild hemlock poisoning (how they came to have this poisoning is unknown).

At press time, Mr. Krakauer decided to change the theme of the simulation from ancient Greece to ancient Rome but was frustrated after a debater channeling Cicero ended up violently suppressing a peasant revolt.
