In a shock to consumers around the country, sources confirmed yesterday that the newest Tranquility White Noise Soother™ employed as its main white noise tape a recording of a man named Jasper discussing his upcoming Cape Cod vacation, amateur tennis, and the capital gains tax.

The unexpected twist in Tranquility Soother™ caused many customers to take to social media and describe their discontent with the newest tape, with many calling it “distracting,” “conceited,” and “I guess pretty accurate.” After stealing our tech head Auguste’s credit card, we managed to secure the Tranquility Soother™ and an Xbox One X. The following is a direct transcript from the Soother:

“So yeah, I’m bringing Helen and the kids down to the cape this spring break. The kids just love sailing so we got them a new double headed sailing ketch for their half birthday and they’ve been dying to try it out. I tell you though, that boat wasn’t cheap; we had to sell some of those stocks we had in the Dutch East India company and the capital gains tax was crazy. Seriously, I must have funded a small public school with that. It was disgusting. Anyway, I’ve been getting into tennis recently. It's a welcome change from hunting our fellow man on Charles’s island. That place has gone to hell ever since they let Donald Trump Jr. in…”

After the initial confusion wore off, many found customers themselves enjoying the newest tape, and Tranquility Systems™ has announced they will be releasing new white noise tapes like “Regatta Chatter,” “Croquet Court,” and “Walt Whitman High School.”
