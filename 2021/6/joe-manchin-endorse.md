Saying that he knew good practical people on both sides of the aisle, Joe Machin broke with his party again yesterday by endorsing his Republican challenger for the West Virginia Senate seat he currently holds. This move solidifies Manchin’s role as a wily politician and man of the center, with many praising this break with tradition as an honorable display of bipartisanship.

Manchin reportedly said the following about his decision:

“Now, I’ve always been a good Democrat [sic], and my fellow Senators understand that when I endorse a person it’s not about the party, but character. So, it’s with great pleasure that I announce my endorsement of Robert Forrest for West Virginia’s Senate seat. Now, I, of course, won’t be dropping out of the race, but I believe that it’s this type of bipartisanship and compromise that this country needs. The Senate used to be a place of merit [sic], respect [sic], and integrity [sic]. And I will do my best to return it to that pristine state [sic].”

Republicans responded to Manchin’s endorsement of Forrest with a multi-million dollar media blitz skewering Manchin as a “socialist demon” while Democratic leadership seriously considered sending Manchin a letter demanding he tell them which date works best for him to have a discussion about why what he is doing could possibly be slightly detrimental to the party.

At press time, Democratic leadership rethought sending the letter after worrying that it might offend Manchin.
