*The Snitch* will be trying something new in this article: two authors working TOGETHER HOLY SHIT I’M SO EXCITED! 

HOLY SHIT, DUDE! DID YOU SEE THE NEWS? That’s right: just before “Spider-Man: No Way Home” (MORE LIKE “SPIDER-MAN: NO WAY THIS IS AS GOOD AS SPIDERVERSE”) released in theatres, Sony released a teaser for A FUCKING SEQUEL TO SPIDER-MAN: INTO THE SPIDERVERSE. FUCK YEAH, BABY! IT’S CONFIRMED!

Not only does the sequel appear to expand on the storyline of the original, but it features the same BEAUTIFUL GODDAMN ANIMATION; I MEAN, HOLY SHIT, LOOK AT THAT! IT’S SO EXPRESSIVE, AND THE WAY IT BLENDS ELEMENTS OF 2D AND 3D STYLE JUST MAKES ME WANNA START **YELLING!!!!****** MORE SO THAN I ALREADY AM! 

GWEN HAS A NEW OUTFIT! HELL TO THE FUCKING YES! I LOVE THIS! CHARACTER DESIGN! DID YOU NOTICE THAT MILES’ NEW SUIT HAS MORE POLISHED ART ON IT? TO SHOW OFF HIS DEVELOPMENT AS A CHARACTER? BECAUSE IT DOES!

HOLY FUCKING SHIT I LOVE SPIDER-MAN!

As of press time, our writers have read the title of the teasers and realized that HOLY SHIT THIS IS ONLY PART ONE! THERE ARE GONNA BE TWO MORE MOVIES! GET FUCKED, MARVEL CINEMATIC UNIVERSE!
