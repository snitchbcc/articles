**Number 5: Malshadocus, The Dark One**\
An imposing name meaning “The Evil Who Lurks in Shadows” derived from the Ominous Chantius dialect of Latin, primarily used for adding atmosphere to horror movies. But as the evil wizard community sees a surge in appreciation for fiendborn with new holidays like Demonblood Heritage Month, this name is sure to make a comeback.

**Number 4: Yor-soloch’Q, Dread Worshipper of the Old Ones**
Though names like this used to be frowned upon in deep cultist circles due to fears of bullying or pronunciation troubles, a similar necromantic revival of cultural heritage is occurring to that of fiendborns … though of course, it wouldn’t be a real evil revival if things didn’t come back wrong! Yor-soloch’Q is a fresh, modern spelling of the classic Old One name YröRR-Slaöe!uq that is sure to sound hip while remaining mind-warping.

**Number 3: Steve Smith, from HR**
Of course, not every evil mage is so obvious about their mastery of the dark arts. Whether by choice or out of fear of persecution for their hunger for human flesh, many blood mage families have adopted what they term “Ordinary White Guy Names.” Of particular note is Steve, a name so generic that it can be infused with a forgetfulness spell to avoid suspicion. 

**Number 2: Shel’Tylen-Al, the Pain-Killer**
Though this name has seen less use in recent years due to unfortunate associations, Shel’Tylen-Al is a classic mad prophet name, having been used by the blind seer Shel’Tylen-Al A-Dural, who killed people painfully (hence the well-known epithet Pain-Killer). However, most broken-minded madmen with visions of what man should not know, hoping to avoid painful associations, instead use other epithets and nicknames (such as B-CC’s own unhinged oracle, Shel’Tailen-Al “Shelton” the Moon-Vexed).

**Number 1: Chadislav the Nicknameable**
This name harkens back to the medieval period when malicious necromancers spread the plague and avoided blame by pinning it on random minority groups. This period is considered by many to be the evil wizard golden age, and as such, many nostalgic magicians, especially liches and deathless ones who experienced it firsthand, love any and all reminders of it. Thus, the now-forgotten medieval European name Chadislav has an inherent appeal to many. But a portion of the name’s popularity also derives from its ability to be shortened into the ordinary name Chad, allowing for easy cover, pronunciation, and, best of all, when reversed, it is the name of the Shadow King Valsidahc, whom we toil to please.
