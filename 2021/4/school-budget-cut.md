This Sunday, news broke of an outrageous school scandal. A teacher at Lee High School in Arkansas has been holding his students hostage for a ransom. Not only that, but our sources have confirmed that this is a daily occurrence that has been transpiring for about three months. The teacher in question, Octavius Krabenapple, gave us an interview earlier this morning to clear up any confusion.

“Ever since the China Virus hit, I’ve been a little short on savings, if you know what I mean,” Mr. Krabenapple stated in our interview, “they cut our salaries, and now I can’t even afford jeans. Then one day, while teaching Bible studies, I thought ‘hey, why not just keep these kids here? I’m sure most of their parents would pay money to get them back.’ So the next day, I just set up my door, locked the window, and wrote a letter asking for $20 for each student’s release from class. Sure enough, I got my $2,000 and let the kids go.” Mr. Krabenapple then went on to explain that he was most surprised not by the lack of protest from the students, but rather by the fact that he has been holding them for ransom for months on end.

“I mean, at some point, you’d think they’d just call the cops, but I’ve been doing this for 90 days now; by this point I’m asking for Snickers and Twix, ‘cause their parents don’t have any money left. This ain’t a very smart town; I'll tell you that. I don't mind though, because I can almost afford a Colt Patterson Revolver.”

“Now, I know it sounds bad,” responded Jeremiah Jackson, the school’s principal, on the topic of the school’s hostage situation(s). “And it is. Truthfully, I would like to stop this from happening, but we don’t have the budget for security. In fact, we don’t have the budget for doors either. Mr. Krabenapple brought his own, which was quite the smart idea, if I do say so myself.”

As of press time, authorities have not taken action on the issue. The Senate has attempted to pass legislation barring teachers from holding students hostage, but has been stopped by filibusters from the GOP on the argument that economic freedom includes the right to make money through any means necessary, including ransoming students.
