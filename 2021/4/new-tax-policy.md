Earlier today, in a press conference held by IRS spokesperson Rudy Wallace, the agency outlined a bold new plan to open up a previously untapped revenue stream by introducing a “swear jar” into American tax policy. This move is being lauded by experts as “innovative,” “surprising,” and “unenforceable goddammit.” 

For more information on this policy, we tried to secure an interview with Mr. Wallace, but he refused to talk to us due to his involvement in an active audit of our tax exempt status as a druidic church. Hail Lugh! We had to make do with *The Snitch*’s Chief Economist, Dr. Reese Sessions:

“This really is just the next logical step in the taxation process. The U.S. has always had vice taxes on harmful substances like alcohol and cigarettes. Words can hurt. Anyone who’s talked to a middle schooler knows that, so it makes perfect sense that, in searching for new revenue, the IRS would choose to create a nationwide ‘swear jar.’ Now, the real problem is how the IRS draws the line on what’s jar worthy. I mean we’ve got the Fs and the Ss and of course the Zs, good Lord of course the Zs. But what about ‘damn?’ Does it really make the cut? Wait, I just checked. It does. Dammit, now I owe — ah shit I said it again — wait I just said shit — dammit.”

At press time, the IRS announced the tax already raised 50 billion dollars after a meeting at *The Snitch* where someone proposed a referential article title. Encouraged by their success, the IRS has levied a battery of new taxes on other harmful activities, such as whistling in public, bringing a crying baby on a plane, and pinging everyone on a Discord server after 10 PM.
