At the end of February 2021, the Department of Military Science declassified a successful experiment in which the heart of a thoroughbred horse and brain of a young male chimpanzee were inserted into the body of a bottlenose dolphin. Further plans were announced to graft the paws of a bengal tiger, fists of a silverback gorilla, and tail of a scorpion onto the creature as well. This experiment is gravely concerning, as the heart of a horse will surely lead the resultant beast down the path to darkness and evil.

In defense of the creature, it is a near-perfect war machine, powerful and receptive to directions. In fact, it killed our Managing Editor, Caleb Levy, with its telepathic beams. And despite the fact that its prose is subpar, its intelligence must be commended; it was able to score a passing grade on the SAT despite not yet having thumbs. But seriously, a horse heart?

I mean, for God’s sake, it's the heart of a *thoroughbred*! A THOROUGHBRED! Not even a Przewalski’s horse, or a Clydesdale; a *thoroughbred*… horses kill about twenty people every year! TWENTY! TWO TIMES TEN! And sure, you can hem and haw about an “increased statistical likelihood of harm based on significant human-horse contact” but that’s horse sympathizer talk!

Seriously, what the hell were they thinking? Sure, I understand that the beast needed a powerful heart to pump blood to its massive brain, but couldn’t they have used, like, a rhinoceros heart, or something? Why a horse? Their hearts are literally coated in a thin layer of glowing black slime! Did they forget the bible verse where God says “Thou shalt not use the heart of horse as a part of your gene-spliced monstrosity?”

Why not use the heart of a human? Without human parts, the beast will be completely without morals and manners! Look at mister Frankenstein over here, making an aberration that’s all screwed up!  At the very least, the good doctor didn’t use a damn horse heart! Jesus! I can let the military playing God slide, but making a monster with a *horse heart*? Unforgivable!

At least they didn’t use any owl body parts. Don’t get me started on those goddamned owls.
