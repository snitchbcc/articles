Earlier today, sources confirmed that IB English student Lauren Dutton was completely blindsided by the really racist third paragraph of the passage she had volunteered to read aloud in class. The reading took place in Ms. Boyce’s IB English 11 class, which is currently reading a collection of short stories by beloved children’s author Rudyard Rhodes, known for such works as *The Savannah Tome* and *The White Dude Who Saves A Bunch Of Brown People*.

Sources from inside the class describe Dutton as volunteering to read aloud a passage from Rhodes’s book *The Topaz Circus*, which, despite its playful and animated characters, took an incredibly racist turn at the third paragraph.

We were able to obtain the recording of the class through our anonymous source Janet Stevenson:

DUTTON: I will, Ms. Boyce.

MS. BOYCE: Go ahead.

DUTTON: ‘And then Mr. Barnaby and Mr. Fromkin showed little Arthur around the magical circus! The brilliant tent springing up as far as little Arthur could see. ‘Why, here are the lions!’ Mr. Barnaby boomed as one of the magnificent beasts tipped his top hat to little Arthur.

‘And look, here are the tigers! They know all the tricks in the world!’ huffed Mr. Fromkin, as one of the tigers looked at little Arthur and said ‘Good day to you, sir!’

‘And here is the pride of our circus, the most majestic beasts in all the world [cough] the [unintelligible] African tribesmen… [cough]

‘But why?’ asked little Arthur, ‘Isn’t it wrong to imprison humans for your circus?’ ‘Why they’re not humans! [cough][unintelligible]’ boomed Mr. Barnaby with a great peal of laughter. ‘I understand the science! Their brain structure is different than that of…”

MS. BOYCE: Ok that’s enough for today.\

At press time, Dutton was once again burned after volunteering to read a passage in IB History before realizing it was an excerpt from *Mein Kampf*.
