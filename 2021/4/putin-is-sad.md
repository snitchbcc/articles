In a press statement earlier today, Putin revealed that he does not appreciate how he is treated by the outside world. He went on to elaborate that he would have never taken power in Russia and oppressed millions of people if he had known others would be so mean to him. This comes in light of Putin recently going private on Instagram and snapping other presidents: “don’t hmu with trade wars rn. Going thru sum stuff.”

Putin’s press statement expresses his discontent with how he is treated by other world leaders, the media, and his own citizens. According to the dictator himself, all he wanted was to rule a country and shape it in his image. However, accusations against him, as well as general bullying, have left him hurt and depressed.

“Being called a murderer was the last straw,” a gloomy Putin lamented in an interview earlier today. “If I had known I would be called such hurtful things, I wouldn’t have gone to all the trouble of taking over Russia. Every time I station troops near a neighbor’s border, the media is on my back about it. Other people shouldn’t feel the need to make fun of me just because I’m such an imposing, Herculean man. At UN meetings, Macron and Trudeau don’t even let me sit at their table. It's just not fair!”

In addition to the already lengthy press statement, Putin also included several poems he had written. One of them reads as follows:

“When riding polar bears is no longer fun,\
All I want to do is run.\
Away from the snow and my mansion on the hill\
If only there was another reporter to kill...”

However, these poems had the unintended effect of proving to other dictators that Putin not only has a soft heart, but also a terrible literary sense.

One brave journalist claimed to have seen Putin eating directly out of a tub of frosting while watching “The Death of Stalin” in his Moscow dwelling. When we contacted him for further questioning, though, the journalist seemed to have gone missing. He is presumed to be on vacation somewhere in Siberia.
