With a deep sinking feeling, it was reported yesterday that a Blue Easter Egg filled with Jelly Beans and hidden during a hunt in 1986, was finally hit with the cold realization that no one is coming.

“I always held out hope that someone would find me,” said the Blue Egg while you mindlessly accepted the paradox of us interviewing it despite it being lost. “But it’s been thirty five years and I don't think the McCarthys even live here anymore. I guess I just finally accepted the reality that I’ve been forgotten. I don’t even care if a *human* finds me anymore, I’d be fine with a racoon or a rat or something.”

At press time the Egg had been found and was finally with a happy family for Easter. Or maybe it's still there, slowly rotting. We don’t know, we’re not journalists. Happy Easter from *The Snitch*!
