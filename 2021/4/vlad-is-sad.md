Late yesterday, sources confirmed that Vlad The Impaler has been complaining about his inability to use new ways of executing prisoners. In the past weeks, rumors have swirled about the Romanian leader complaining to his closest advisors about these constraints. 

We interviewed Vlad to get his thoughts on the matter:

“This is ridiculous. You impale a couple people and they call you Vlad The Impaler. That’s the kind of name that sticks you know. I’ve got to stick with my brand. I just have been feeling a little down lately. I mean over the past ten years executions have gotten so much more creative. I saw a guy get executed by being literally torn apart by wild animals, and here I am, stuck with impaling. I’ve literally run out of fun ways to impale people. I’ve looked all over the world for new weapons but lately, the supply has run dry.”

We recommended that Vlad try meditation classes to help his anger. He agreed, saying he could always impale the teacher if it didn’t work.

As of press time, the ruler has been hit with more bad luck. A sudden illness has left him in bed due to elongated teeth and horrible sunburns.
