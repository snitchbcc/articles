With the Oscar coming up soon, many are looking forward to bashing the ceremony for its awful nominations, bloated length, overreliance on celebrity guest stars, undeserved winners, and general disregard for film as an artistic medium. However, some people, such as Jack Wolfson of Montana, are looking forward to the Oscars. The award show will help Jack determine which new film he should watch by means of the ceremony’s “Best Picture” winner. Jack further elaborated on his opinion in an interview earlier today. 

“I never know which new movies to watch. I don’t wanna waste my time going to the theater just to see some crappy film that makes me wanna throw my popcorn at the screen. I’m better than that. So yesterday, I decided to just let the Oscars tell me what to watch. Unlike the sheeple who’ll watch anything with CGI in it, I rest my opinion in the hands of the Academy Awards, a sacred and holy ceremony that has never let me down. Unlike my first and third wives.”

Jack is looking forward to seeing whichever film the Oscars determines is the best of the year. Once the ceremony is over, Jack explained, he will watch the movie and pretend it was his clear favorite to win the whole time, proving his superiority over all other movie-goers. When we asked him if he could name at least one of the nominees for best picture, though, Jack seemed to have forgotten his keys and left the interview.

Jack has received criticism for his decision. Many friends and family believe this is a ploy to seem more intelligent or cultured than he actually is. On top of this, his brother argues that taking the Oscar’s decision seriously already shows how desperate Jack is. No logical person actually believes the Oscars have any legitimate value, other than to make fun of. I mean, they think they’re soooo smart because they choose “artistic” and “deep” movies that no one cares about. Snobs.

As always, unbiased reporting coming from the Snitch. More on the story soon.
