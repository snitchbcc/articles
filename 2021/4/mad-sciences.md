Lauding the department as a revitalization of MCPS’s faltering science curriculum, the Administration announced yesterday that B-CC’s new Mad Science Department will include never-before-seen AP courses, such as Mad Botany, Mad Psychology, and Mad Anthropology. This move is a direct response to recent concerns voiced by the mad scientific community that Chinese schools may be overtaking U.S. schools in mad-STEM related areas.

For more information on these new courses, we talked to Dr. Greg Crichton, MCPS’s spokesperson for the new department:

“Students in the U.S. have a woefully inadequate mad science education. The few courses that we do have only focus on orthodox subjects, like Mad Biology and Mad Chemistry, and these didn’t even have their own department until now. Instead of basic projects, like creating a Frankenstein’s Monster in a Mad Biology course, we offer students the opportunity to create entire petri-dish civilizations which they can then rule as a malevolent god in Mad Biochemistry. In Mad Botany, we allow free reign for the creation of massive carnivorous plants. And in Mad Psychology, we just teach students what they would have been taught in a normal psych class fifty years ago.”

While the new department and courses have garnered praise from many, others are not as thrilled. Some criticisms state that instead of expanding the courses the money would be better spent on campaigns encouraging women to find careers in mad-STEM, as the gender gap in the megalomaniacal villain demographic has continued to grow in recent years. Others believe that a portion of the budget should be allocated to the teaching of Mad Humanities.

At press time, Mad Physics was removed from the B-CC Mad Science Department's curriculum after it was found to be too similar to IB Physics.
