**Letter From Amos Conrad:**

Help me. I can’t say how lng it will be until my fhone slips so I’ll make this quick. I was out hikng and I trippd and fell into a ravine. I tried to clim out, but a bulder got dislodged and fell on my arm. Im trpped and it's been 5 days. my fone was hanging from my belt but I’ve managed to balance it on my foot so I can write this email. Youve got to help me. I’m running out of food and water. I included my cordinates as an atachment. [51.5125556, -0.2189334]
