A new era of science dawned yesterday after it was discovered that a sandwich, left in a locker at B-CC over the summer, had become so saturated with bacteria that it achieved sentience.

The sentient sandwich was first discovered by MCPS administrator Maria Marquez, who told us about the experience during an interview.

“You know, I’ve seen a lot of weird things get left in lockers over the summer, but an entirely new complex organism capable of thought and rudimentary speech? Top ten. Probably. So I was in school picking up some papers and while I was walking along I heard this voice say ‘What am I?’ I assumed it was some emo kid who’d snuck into the school and gotten stoned in a bathroom, but as I got closer to the voice I realized it was coming from a locker. I opened the locker and I saw this writhing mass that looked vaguely like a sandwich.”

The locker in question belongs to local nimrod Chip Stewart. We interviewed Stewart as he and his friends were setting off fireworks in a public park. He told us:

“Man, that sandwich I left in there came to life? That’s lit bro. You think I could turn it in for a science experiment?”

Unfortunately, we had to end our interview with Stewart early, after our Managing Editor Caleb got his finger blown off by a stray firework.

At press time, the sandwich had been enrolled in B-CC as a sophomore, and was reportedly lamenting the cruel world that brought it into existence after taking its first Honors Pre Calc class.
