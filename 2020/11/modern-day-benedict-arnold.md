An audible gasp emanated from the 4th period AP Euro class three days ago. *Snitch* reporters were on the virtual scene immediately as our news detecting seismograph registered “shit went down.” We arrived just after what witnesses are calling “the betrayal of the century.” The betrayal in question was that of 11th grader Steve Bowman who, as his virtual AP Euro class was coming to an end, unmuted himself and asked the teacher, Mr. Durling, if there was any homework. 

This was shocking as Mr. Durling had not taken his memory supplement and was only five minutes from dismissing the class without homework. That shock was compounded by Bowman’s previous status as “pretty chill” and “an okay dude.” 

Linda Mantel, a student present in the class when the incident occurred, told us that she was “sickened” by Bowman’s sociopathic display of ethical obligation. Following the incident, the other students in the class banded together to agree not to do the homework in protest of Bowman’s behavior. 

This morning, we received news that Bowman had once again betrayed the class by completing the reading assignment and getting an A on the pop quiz, which everyone else failed.
