*This article includes a Nazi. He says Nazi shit. The Snitch in no way condones said shit, not even if we can monetize it.*

In a shocking and uncomfortable interview yesterday, *Snitch* reporters uncovered that local grammar Nazi Christopher Hamsun might also be a regular Nazi. *Snitch* reporters were originally interviewing Hamsun as a local interest story due to his frequent grammar corrections of online posts. 

*Snitch* reporters got their first indication that Hamsun’s Nazism may extend beyond grammar when, during our interview, Hamsun said this:

“You know I really hate when people use dangling modifiers. It just drives me up the wall. You know what else I really dislike, those New York liberals. You know which New York liberals I’m talking about, the ones that control everything.”

**Wow**. *Snitch* reporters were kind of surprised by the dark turn that conversation took. We started edging towards the door as Hamsun continued talking while rubbing his shaved head with the palm of his hand and petting his German Shepherd with the other. He continued,

“It infuriates me when people use unclear antecedents, and it's always the same kind of people. You know who I’m talking about right? Don’t make me spell it out for you.”

We clarified that we did not know who he was talking about as we continued slowly shifting towards the door. Seemingly not noticing, he continued with his rant:

“Grammar is about structure, you know? It’s like society, everything in its proper place ensuring purity. Purity of grammar and purity of… other things. And sometimes we have to ensure purity using the same methods we use when dealing with a wayward comma. **Deletion**.”

At this point, we decided subtlety wasn’t what was needed in this situation, sprayed him in the face with a can of mace, and sprinted up the stairs out of the basement of his mother's house where he currently lives.
