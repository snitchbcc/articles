The COVID-19 pandemic has derailed vacation travel, but a new app called *VirtualVacay* is bringing the vacation to you! The up-and-coming service launched its first “vacation”, a Paris-centered experience, yesterday.

To make the experience fully authentic, *VirtualVacay* employs a number of tactics: they pump Parisian air into your home and import any foods directly from the *creperies* and *cafes* on the street. But most impressive of all, they send a surly Frenchman to your house to look at you dismissively, blow cigarette smoke in your face, and mutter “Vous les Américains. Vous êtes tellement stupides.”

How awesome is that? I was given a free trial to write my review and found that, while the whole experience was amazing, I was only truly immersed in the beauty of Paris when a Frenchman named Jacques shoved me out of his way and put his cigarette stub out on my arm!

It truly is a revolutionary experience! I rate it 7.5/10! The only problem I had was that Jacques had to crash on my couch and the entire house is now saturated with the stench of cheap wine, menthol, and his overpowering cologne.

I can’t wait for *VirtualVacay* to expand into other countries - I’ve heard that *VirtualVacay: Lagos* will include sending a corrupt policeman to your house to extort 10,000 Naira from you!

*This article includes several insulting stereotypes. The Snitch in no way advocates stereotyping, unless we can monetize it**.*
