Earlier today, in a stunning move that may signal an emerging trend, Archmont College announced that they would be going application optional. This comes after more and more colleges, in light of the COVID pandemic, have gone test optional to ease the burden on prospective students.

Archmont College President, Jill Sinclair, has described her college’s decision to go application optional as “the next logical step” in a series of pandemic-fueled changes meant to make the college process easier for students. At a press conference, Sinclair stated:

“The college application process is very tough on students. We’ve seen how many colleges are trying to ease the burden by allowing students to apply without standardized test scores. Well, we’ve decided to one up those bastards by going application optional. That’s right - no more Common App, no Coalition either. The freshman class next year is just going to be whoever wanders on campus.”

Many have praised Archmont’s innovative new way of catering to students. Not to be outdone, several other colleges immediately announced that they would also be going application optional, including Harvard, Princeton, and Brown. 

At press time, Archmont had raised the bar again by announcing that they would also be going attendance optional for the next academic year.
