In an exclusive interview with former sixteen-time world champion John Cena, the star was artfully forced to let slip the stunning truth: pro wrestling is not actually a legitimate sporting competition. He went on to expose the fact that the so-called “wrestlers” are told who is going to win a match before it happens. With a little *ahem* persuasion, he then took it even further, admitting that they are also told exactly how to act. The horrible humans that we all grew up despising, like Rowdy Roody Piper, are simply “heels”, a backstage term for a bad guy. Even worse, our heroes like Hulk Hogan and the Ultimate Warrior are simply “baby faces”, or good guys.

Determined to prove that Cena was simply lying for attention, I did some more investigating, and what I found was even more shocking. Wrestlers, I uncovered, are like actors, simply playing a character on TV. The Undertaker, for instance, is not an undead wizard turned biker turned undead wizard again, but is in fact a regular old 55 year old man named Mark Calaway. But the biggest shock came when sitting down with perhaps the most famous wrestler alive, the Rock. He revealed, through a little coaxing, that Stone Cold Steve Austin and Vince McMahon were and still are on good terms. The years of legendary battles between the two were nothing more than an act for the cameras, leading us to believe that they were sworn enemies.

The enormity of this revelation has left me desperate for more information. At press time I am currently trying to use my journalistic prowess to wheedle more of the biggest secrets in the Wrestling Industry.
