Breaking news today from the International Baccalaureate Organization as director Dr. Siva Kumari has announced that they will be introducing new dice rolling technology into the grading grading process for both exams and internal assessments.

The move comes after the IBO faced criticism last test season over its lack of transparency on the process of calculating IB scores. A press release from the IBO states,

“We have decided, at the behest of many in the IB community, to retire our old grading algorithm in favor of a more accurate and streamlined process - several IB experts will roll dice to determine the grades to be assigned for a class.”

Critics have decried this decision, noting that under this new system, no students will receive sevens as the highest number on the new IB grading dice is a six. 

These seemingly random scores have proved advantageous for some and disastrous for others. Among the beneficiaries is local IB student Dale Bell, a tester of the new system, who was randomly assigned a five in IB French Six, a grade which he freely admits he had no business getting.
