*The Snitch* continues its Pulitzer-winning journalism with a stunning new investigation into whether there is a test today. The answer, HOLY SHIT THERE IS! WE COMPLETELY FORGOT TO STUDY! It’s alright. Maybe it's an easy subject and we can bluff through the test. *Calculus*. Oh god. Oh no. This could affect our conditional acceptance to Harvard-Oxford-Princeton’s joint journalism school. 

We were just so busy tracking down leads for our investigative piece that we forgot to check if we had any tests this week, and then we had to perform that goat sacrifice to keep our tax exempt church status. We’re sorry readers but we can’t finish this article - the test is 3rd period and we’ve got to cram.
