**Letter From Micheal Liu:**

Hi, I’m a huge fan of *The Snitch* and a new junior at B-CC. *The Snitch* seems like the number one news source at B-CC, so I figured if I had a question I should come to you. Anyway, here’s my question: school has been in session for a couple of weeks now and I’ve been showing up to class every day, but where is everyone else? Every morning I get up and walk to school, I open one of the back doors with a keycard I found, and I go to my classes, but no one is there, not even teachers. What the hell is going on? Is my calendar wrong? I would check my MCPS email but I don’t have the password and can’t log on. I’m new to B-CC this year so I think maybe it could be like a hazing thing? That would take an insane amount of commitment. I was honestly a little worried about what MCPS would do about school during the pandemic, but that was around the time I forgot my email password. Maybe I missed an email.
