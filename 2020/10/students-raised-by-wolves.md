New transfer students raised by wolves in a small forest outside of Chevy Chase, Maryland have spoken out against Montgomery County Public School’s new remote learning system, saying the organization of online school is “disgraceful”. The transfer students were brought up in a local forest in the county, and after officials rescued them, Child Protective Services decided it would make the most sense to integrate the feral wolf children into modern society. Doctors all across the nation have been waiting to hear their first words since learning English, and it was a big scientific event when one of them asked, “Is Baron Time really necessary?” on September 1st. Since that first breakthrough, more and more of the transfer students’ questions have poured in, many about how Wednesdays are supposed to work. Many of the sophomore transfers have begun talking in detail, trying in vain to figure out what MYP seminar is a month into the school year.

“Their ability to catch onto speech so quickly really shocked us,” said Doctor Deborah Teacher, who declined to make a comment about her last name. Dr. Teacher was the leading scientist facilitating the children's reeducation, and is eager to see just how much they have learned in the short month since they arrived in modern society.

Dr. Teacher and her fellow scientists have indicated that they want to test the students’ intelligence, but they were unable to due to the IQ test servers crashing from overload just minutes before the testing was due to begin. Dr. Teacher maintains that their average IQ is most likely around 85 due to their unorthodox upbringing.

At press time, one of the incoming freshmen had reported, “Arf!”, which roughly translates to, “That’s still probably a good ten points higher than the people in charge of MCPS this year.”
