A theater kid's lifelong dream came true during this past weekend's events, hosted by The Humanity Entertaining All The Enlightened Recluses, or THEATER. She won one of the most coveted awards that was given out, the Most Hamilton References award. The description of said award reads “For the person who is the most talented at shoehorning in Hamilton references at least five times a conversation.” The winner, Ebonie Daveis, a 16 year old junior at BCC, nearly fainted when being presented the award by Betsy Struxness, an original member of the ensemble, further cementing her status as Hamilton super fan by knowing who Struxness was.

Her case for a repeat win started in her acceptance speech. “*The world has been turned upside down*, I know *you’ll be back* next year, and that *when my children tell my story they’ll tell the story of tonight.* First I’d like to thank a couple of people. The first is my *right hand man,* my best friend Jamison, and the others are my parents James and Vickie. Now we need to talk about *what comes next* I want to tell each and every one of you that *history has its eyes on you,* and, *one last time*,** thank you.”
