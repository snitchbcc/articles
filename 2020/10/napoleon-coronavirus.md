In an exclusive interview for the Snitch, former French general Napoleon Bonaparte has commended the Coronavirus for its conquest of Europe. Bonaparte, who was famously very close to taking over Europe, was impressed with how quickly Europe was brought to its knees. Shaking his head despondently, he  muttered,:  “It took me 11 years, and I didn’t even take the whole continent, the virus took Europe in like two weeks.”

We asked Napoleon why the Coronavirus has been so much more successful than himself. “I had to rely on some moronic underlings to competently execute my master plans. The coronavirus relies on nobody. Furthermore, the virus is much better equipped to deal with those bastards in Russia. The coronavirus needs no food, no supplies, and best of all, those bloody Russians can’t retreat from it.” At this point Napoleon left our interview, grumbling about allying himself with the virus and claiming it would be much more effective than Spain, Italy, or Holland.
