Students today got a shock regarding their job prospects after a school assigned career test. The test, which is based on new software boasting 100% accuracy, assigned nearly everyone some version of the “post apocalyptic scavenger” job.

The test in question was given to students during last week's baron time, and was meant to “provide students with a comprehensive way to measure their aptitude toward a variety of career prospects.” Unfortunately, instead of rating students on traditional aptitude traits such as “creative,” “risk taking,” “organized,” or “inquisitive,” it based all job recommendations off of new traits like “ruthlessness,” “will to survive,” “ability to withstand extreme amounts of pain,” and “deliciousness.” 

Some students were disappointed with the roles they were assigned:

“I was expecting to get something like a business consultant,” said Daphne Melville, “instead I got  ‘wasteland scavenger’. I clicked to see the average salary that wasteland scavengers get but it only said ‘canned foods, bullet casings, and the wish that you died in the cataclysm.’”

Others were pleased or confused:

“I’m actually pretty happy with mine,” said Alexander Pope, “I mean sure, I was hoping to get lawyer, but ‘Irradiated Cult Messiah’ sounds pretty great too! It’s a leadership position and I get the best shiny scraps my followers find.”

We also talked to Herman de Maurier who, after ranking especially highly on the “deliciousness” scale had only been assigned a job called “dinner.” After carrying out an extensive survey we have identified the most common careers and listed them below.

1. Wasteland Scavenger
2. Vapor Cloud
3. Cannibalistic Cult Victim
4. Cannibalistic Cult Member
5. *Snitch* Reporter

That’s right! No matter what comes, and by the looks of the career test it won’t be good, *The Snitch* survives and will continue bringing you humor and news wherever you may be, from the D.C. mega crater, to the cannibal caves of Appalachia, and everywhere in between!
