Did you know that before *The Snitch* perfected the art of satire, other people and organizations tried? We at *The Snitch*, as the foremost humor publication in the known universe, feel that it is our duty to pay respects to the primitive attempts at satire that have come before us. 

**48,000 BCE:** 
The first attempt at satire is recorded in a cave painting where bunny ears are drawn on a wooly mammoth. The badly dented skull of the presumed humorist was found next to it.

**2000 BCE:** 
The Egyptian scholar Maat of Alexandria is executed after drawing a mustache on a sphinx statue.

**60 CE:**
John of Bethesda is crucified by Roman authorities after distributing a scroll inscribed with “Emperor Nero is a zero.”

**1517 CE:**
German printmaker Jonas of Brandenburg uses humor as social commentary by posting “95 reasons why Cardinal Tetzel smells like horse dung” on a church door. He was burned at the stake as a heretic two days later.

**1776 CE:** 
Satire is first used to bring people together when pamphleteer Frederick Agony is tarred and feathered by both British and American Revolutionary forces after publishing a pamphlet called “Uncommon Sense.”

**1950 CE:**
American humorist Fred Helman is brought before the HUAC after publishing an article titled “I know the names of five whiskey bottles in Joe McCarthy when he made up his communist list.”

**2019 CE:**
*The Snitch* is founded after a student at B-CC decides he needs an extra activity to fill a blank space on his resume.

**2020 CE:**
*The Snitch* becomes the most illustrious publication in this and all parallel universes.
