President Trump made headlines across the country this morning with the announcement of his testing positive for COVID-19. This news has raised questions about the future of his presidential campaign, even as new data suggest that undecided voters who also received positive COVID tests seem to be leaning towards Trump after this announcement.

An anonymous voter from Florida reported that she had been going to vote for Former Vice President Biden, until she heard the news of his COVID test. “It makes him more relatable, y’know?” she said. “I was real worried by his relaxed response to the 200,000 deaths, but if *he* has COVID, I’m sure he’ll start taking it very seriously. That’s the kind of man we need in office.” She isn’t the only one turning towards Trump after the news. Trump has surged 3 points among the elderly, especially people who were infected, mostly southern grandmothers saying they would “pray for him.” Among infected voters, he’s gone up 10 points, making his campaign considerably more threatening to Biden’s.
	
There are some concerns, however, that Trump became infected even with strict protection methods against serious threats, such as waiters wearing masks while they handled the Presidents plates and food. Many political scientists had theorized that, in the event that Trump did receive a positive test, he would choose to not report it, or even cast doubt on the reliability of the test. Dr. Verman Politiczuck, our resident political contributor, theorized that this whole test could be a ploy by the Trump team to raise his approval ratings, especially among those infected.

“Infected people were his lowest voting demographic,” Dr. Politiczuck explained. “They were the ones who suffered from his lack of action for COVID early on, and their bitterness has carried over into how they’ve been polling. It’s no coincidence that he jumped 10 points among infected voters right after he supposedly ‘got’ COVID. For weeks he’s been saying that testing is unhelpful and this virus is not serious, and the debate, he did nothing to help convince people that he has taken this seriously. This is perhaps the only way he could convince people that he’s committed to taking COVID seriously, while at the same time making himself more relatable to Americans who have already been infected.” Dr. Politiczuck maintains that with President Trump’s strict protocol on protecting himself from COVID, it would be “nearly impossible” for him to have an actual positive result.

At press time, President Trump announced he was going to award both the machine that gave him his results and its Russian repairmen the presidential medal of freedom.
