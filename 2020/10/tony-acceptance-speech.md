A new study has found that every student in the auditions for the newest B-CC theater production is mentally drafting their acceptance speech for the prestigious Tony Awards. 

Every single student wandering around outside the theater waiting to audition was, instead of memorizing their lines, thinking about who they would thank or snub after they had been awarded the highest theater honor in the nation.

“I’d like to thank everyone who helped me to get to where I am today,” Minerva Flemming, one of the ten students auditioning for the female lead of the musical, was heard muttering. Instead of preparing in any way shape or form for the rapidly approaching audition, Flemming (and everyone else) was basking in the imaginary fame and glory that getting into this play would place them on the path to. 

At press time, the directors of the play had decided to postpone the production after every prospective actor inadvertently recited their acceptance speech instead of the lines they were assigned to memorize.
