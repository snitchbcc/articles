The most recent edition of “BCC’s Award Winning Literary Magazine™” has just been released, and for only $15 more than you’re willing to spend! The release was a smashing success, selling a full 20 copies, enough to match exactly the number of the magazine's writers (by chance I’m sure). 

Now, I know that you loyal readers are just dying to know our personal opinions on the latest edition of Chips. Well, you’re in luck as we can definitively reveal that Chips, “BCC’s Award Winning Literary Magazine™,” is pretty good. 

At least, we presume it’s pretty good. You see, the entire staff at *The Snitch* couldn’t pool together the fifteen dollars needed to buy “BCC’s Award Winning Literary Magazine™.” If we had that kind of money, we could have a decent website or maybe even a couple of decent writers - the possibilities would be endless.
