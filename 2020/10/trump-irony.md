Yesterday, in what experts are calling an “avalanche of irony”, President Donald Trump has contracted the coronavirus, accidentally opened a can of teargas in his face, and been run over by a mail truck. 

The President’s hectic day started at 1 AM, when his coronavirus test came back positive. This comes after months of Trump and his circle refusing to wear masks, ignoring social distancing guidelines, and diminishing the virus. 

However, the President’s day was about to get more ironic as just a few hours later, during a budget meeting, the President accidentally opened a canister of tear gas in his own face. The exact circumstances of the tear gassing incident are unknown, some sources have the President opening the canister with his teeth after absentmindedly gnawing on it while bored during the meeting. Other sources have the canister going off after the President hurled it at Steve Mnuchin while calling him Steve M-no-chin after Mnuchin tried to brief the president on the stock market decrease.

The President’s intensely ironic day continued as, after stumbling in a feverish haze out of the tear gassed room and into the street, he was run over by a mail truck on its morning deliveries. While we can’t say if the President’s day of irony will continue, we believe that Eric Trump may be currently trapped in a cage.
