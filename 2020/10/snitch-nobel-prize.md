Breaking news from Stockholm as the Nobel Prize Committee announced they have created a new Nobel Prize in Journalism for the sole purpose of giving it to *The Snitch*. 

In a statement released by Johann Strömberg, the head of the new Journalism Prize Committee, he explained this unprecedented move.

“We have decided that sometimes tradition must be upended when a once-in-a-lifetime talent is discovered. *The Snitch*’s unconventional approach to the journalistic method has produced remarkable results the quality of which are unrivaled by any other publication in human history. It is truly an honor for us at the Nobel Committee to give the award in journalism to such a prestigious publication.”

We at *The Snitch* are honored to accept the prize, and will toss it onto our awards pile with utmost care so it can be among our other most prestigious awards: eight Pulitzer prizes, the “Best in Show” award from Westminster Dog Show, and the Order of Lenin from the now dissolved Soviet Union. 

Bitter and obsolete news organizations such as *The Washington Post* and *The New York Times* have made baseless claims that the prize was awarded to us based on *Snitch* reporters obtaining photographs of Strömberg and other Nobel officials in compromising situations. We assure you this is not true, and that all compromising materials we obtain are used in an ethical and socially acceptable manner.
