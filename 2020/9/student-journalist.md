Early Thursday morning, sources have confirmed that student journalist, Chuck Mitchell, is acting like his new story on the cafeteria’s pricing is goddamn Watergate. 

“This has to get out!” Mitchell reportedly shouted while slamming his hands dramatically on a desk. Who this was directed towards is unknown at this time, as our source who was looking through a window noted he was the only one in the room. He is also reported to have been muttering about his article during classes, but refusing to talk about it when asked. Instead saying,

“You’ll know soon enough,” implying his article matters in the least and isn’t just asinine puffery. 

Mitchell has also been setting up “clandestine meetings” with “anonymous informants” to gather information for the article. These “clandestine meetings” mostly consist of Mitchell pacing around a classroom acting like he’s going to get a Pulitzer while an anonymous informant (mostly other students from his Journalism class) looks on with a mixture of worry and annoyance. 

At press time, an administration official walked into Mitchell’s Journalism class to give another student a note. After the administrator greeted Mitchell and asked how his article was going Mitchell is reported to have clambered out a first floor window while yelling,

“The tools of the state have come to silence me, but they’ll never succeed! I am a bastion of the free press! The truth will always prevail!”

We here at *The Snitch* would like to humbly request that, should we ever get so pompous you whack us upside the head.
