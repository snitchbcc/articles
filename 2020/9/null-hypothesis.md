Earlier today, in a revelation that psychiatrists around the world are calling “groundbreaking,” the Null Hypothesis finally opened up about its fear of rejection. 

This breakthrough follows years of intensive therapy by the nation’s top psychoanalyst, Elizabeth Williams, who, in an interview, shared the unique difficulties involved in treating the notoriously neurotic and misunderstood statistical concept:

“Now for most people, talking about their mother, asking them to describe a random doodle, or repeatedly telling them ‘it’s not your fault’ seems to work after a couple of weeks. The Null Hypothesis, however, is in the unique position of hearing that it needs to be rejected countless times in science and statistics classes around the world. Also, the Null Hypothesis’ lack of corporeal being made it difficult to employ the classic strategy of staring it in the eyes until it breaks into tears.”

The breakthrough finally arrived after Williams questioned the Null Hypothesis about its most devastating rejection: tenth grader Jeffery Patchett rejecting it during his science fair project concerning the height of foam from different colored Mentos put in Coke bottles.

We here at *The Snitch* wish the Null Hypothesis well and are glad that it has overcome its fear before the first AP Stats quiz next Monday.
