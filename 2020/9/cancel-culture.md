In a press conference today, a group of students voiced their disgust at how far “cancel culture” has come. The group consisted of over fifty-seven seniors that had recently been revealed to have participated in fire startings at local parties in local parks, as well as in the BCC High School Parking Lot.

“So we had a little fun, we weren’t hurting anybody,” said Tanner Buttstarch, the self-appointed spokesman for the group. “We just wanted to hang around, have some fun, and douse a park in gasoline. Lots of kids our age are doing it! And ALSO, it’s not the job of some woke ass-tivists to try and ruin our lives!” Buttstarch took a moment to giggle at his own pun, and then continued speaking. As he resumed his impassioned speech, a reporter in the crowd yelled, “You set three houses on fire!” to which Buttstarch replied, “No no no, twenty houses. All spread out.” The student reporter tried to rush onto the podium, shouting “Twenty? People are dying Tanner!” before being taken away by security.

The revelations came after a group of students compiled a letter, with every post detailing the events. The letter was leaked to the public in an unfinished version, with information that had not yet been completely verified. 

Upon the leak, the students implicated in the letter began an intimidation campaign against the writers, with posts being spammed with comments like “Our fire, our choice” and “Can’t even let someone burn in peace”. A source inside the group has said that the person responsible for said leak has been identified. As of press time, one of the authors has shut down his social media to seclude himself from the response.

Upon being asked by Snitch reporters if they had any regrets about setting fires in an area filled with wood, Buttstarch replied, “Bro, take a joke! All we did was light some wood on fire!” Buttstarch then removed his mask and pulled out a lighter, setting the mask ablaze. He was subsequently chased off school grounds by security, yelling about going to the Tattler.
