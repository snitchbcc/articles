Admitting that he was not entirely sure which denomination’s church he attended, area Christian Gregory Vaughn later clarified to *Snitch* reporters that by not entirely sure he actually meant he had absolutely no idea what type of Christian he was.

“I mean I think I’m a protestant, but the priest at my church wears one of those huge funny hats? But I think he also might be married. Do you guys know what type of priests can get married?”

We were unfortunately unable to help him as *Snitch* reporters are all Celtic Druids for tax purposes. After unsuccessfully searching for a labelled bible, Vaughn continued,

“I mean we’ve got Jesus and God, but most Christians have them don’t they… Uh, I think we’ve also got some weird ghost thing? I usually zone out by the ghost part of the sermon but I’m pretty sure he’s not a scary one. I think we’re one of the ones that's chill overall. Every now and then we get some wine and bread and the priest says that we’re eating Jesus. Pretty weird, but I think it’s probably symbolic.”

At press time, we had provided Mr. Vaughn with several pamphlets relating to Druidism and he had agreed to come to a few of our meetings.
