An exclusive obtained by *The Snitch* has revealed a very troubling secret that puts the lives of millions around the world in jeopardy. For as long as vampires have existed, it has been well known that they can only enter a house if they are invited in. However, it has recently been uncovered that vampires have long figured out a way past such pesky restrictions.

Welcome mats have long been a staple of millions of homes across the world, but recent insights into their origins reveal something sinister. According to our source, who wished to remain anonymous, the creator of the welcome mat was secretly a vampire. Our source also alleges that these welcome mats count as the very welcome these vampires need to enter your home. However, there is some hope for people as well. The caveat is that “Welcome” must be written on the mat.

We here at *The Snitch* recommend that all who own these mats remove them from their doorsteps at once. We also hope that this startling piece of information is taken into account by the police in breaking and entering cases, past, present, and future.
