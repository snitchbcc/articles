President Trump left his advisors scrambling this week when, after being asked about what role Christianity played in his life, he responded with a vitriolic rant targeting Christ himself.

“Messiah? Sure, he’s a god because he got killed. You know what? I prefer gods who don’t get killed,” the visibly agitated President said at a press conference Tuesday. He continued, “I mean I don’t get it, why do people worship that loser? What was in it for him? Any deity with half a brain would have face melted those Romans the second they came for him. You know I’ve heard a lot of people saying that he kind of had the crucifixion coming.”

At this point in the press conference, Trump apparently shambled off the stage, ripped a crucifix from his press secretary’s neck, and left the room mumbling about how “the holes in his hands were gross” and that “no Americans want to see that.”

After leaving the press conference, Trump doubled down on his previous statements in a tweet barrage calling Jesus “A RADICAL SOCIALIST,” “A HUGE LOSER,” and “UN-AMERICAN.” 

In a memo obtained by *The Snitch*, it was revealed that after learning about Christ’s Middle Eastern origins Trump had ordered Homeland Security to screen him for possible terrorist connections.
