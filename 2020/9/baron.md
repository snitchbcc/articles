The B-CC Baron is under fire today, after a large gathering of nobility protested the insensitive portrayal of landed gentry. The protest was attended by nobility from all over the world. Prussian *Junkers*, French *Chevaliers*, Japanese *Kazoku*, and countless viscounts, earls, and marquis were all present to protest what they consider blatantly stereotyping. 

We met with the chosen representative of the nobility, Robert Edward Maximillian Ivan Carloman de Medici-Jagiellon-Habsburg-Hauteville-Fitzroy, 16th Baron d’Orleans, 8th Count of Leeds, 34th Thane of Glamis, Heir to the Duchy of Aquitaine, Earldom of Northumbria, and the Margravate of Miessen, at the Starbucks down the road. When asked about the B-CC Baron he told us,

“The stereotypes presented by the B-CC mascot are disgusting, from his snooty combativeness to his monocle. A monocle! I never! When I first saw the B-CC mascot I was taken aback! How dare some lowborn serfs appropriate our image! I immediately went to my second cousin-great aunt-sister in law to discuss the necessary steps to remedy such an abomination.”

Opinions remain divided on the mascot. Many local businesses support the nobility, as the area has profited from the eighteen thousand servants that were brought along as part of the nobles’ entourages. 

As an independent news organization *The Snitch* is required to be neutral on these issues but in this case we have decided to make a rare exception and throw our support behind the nobility. We wish to make clear that this is entirely unrelated to both the donation of several thousand ducats we received from a Delawarean business, and the granting to us of several titles in the Peerage of Flanders.
