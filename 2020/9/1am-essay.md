A new report published by Your English Teacher sheds light on the immense disparity between the perceived and actual quality of the essay you wrote at 1:00 AM. The report showed that many of the elements of the essay that you thought were amazing during your caffeine fueled all night writing session were in fact incoherent ramblings of your sleep deprived brain. 

The report specifically highlighted an instance where what you remember as the crowning achievement of your essay actually read “Lady Macbeth is Mr. Macbeth in the cense that sterogender unnnormative roles have influenced the collectivve subconscious and usurped her modernity insinct.”

The report also noted several spelling errors where you replaced “assess” with “asses” and “corollary” with “coronary”. These errors were followed by an entire paragraph of commas interspersed with lyrics of the song you were listening to at the time.
