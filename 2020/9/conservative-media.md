Conservative media was outraged this week after sources confirmed that protestors, who have for the past several weeks been forced into unmarked vans, were required to wear masks in compliance with local law.

Seething-mass-of-bigoted-rats-in-ill-fitting-human-skin Tucker Carlson took part of his anger hour to adress the scandal, saying,

“Now, the radical leftists would have you believe that this story is about protestors being kidnapped by a private police force, but that just isn’t the case, the *real* story here is the otherwise blameless and brave federal agents forcing the thugs to wear masks, in complete violation of their civil liberties.”

While the conservative voting base still overwhelmingly supports President Trump’s detainment of protestors, many see the forced mask wearing as a step in the wrong direction. At press time many conservative commentators had released a list of civil rights and liberties that are on the table for violation, while highlighting a select few (guns and no masks) that should be protected.
