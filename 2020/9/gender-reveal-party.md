In a press conference held today, several of the most prominent European historians announced that they had found new evidence that an ill-planned gender reveal party caused the Franco-Prussian War. 

The conference was led by Johann Faust, the preeminent scholar on European history from 1860-1880, who, in cooperation with several other historians at Fälschung University, recently uncovered a trove of correspondence between French and German diplomats that shed new light on the actual causes of the 1870-71 war. According to Faust:

“For many years we were operating under the false assumption that the Franco-Prussian war was engineered by Otto von Bismarck in his quest for German unification. This was incorrect. New evidence has surfaced, and we can now conclusively state that the Franco-Prussian war was caused by a gender reveal party in which French soldiers fired off cannons filled with blue dust to celebrate the presumed gender of the child of their commander Réne Zola. Unfortunately, the cannon fire was interpreted by a nearby Prussian patrol as an attack, and so the war began.”

When Dr. Faust was asked why the soldiers were having a gender reveal party roughly ninety years before the technology required to tell the gender of a child in utero was invented, he responded,

“Shut up nerd. This is cool. Stop ruining it.”
