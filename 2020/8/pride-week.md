An argument broke out recently among the Seven Deadly Sins, who misinterpreting Pride Month, all demanded months of their own. The event, which takes place throughout June, is a celebration of all things LGBTQ+, not the sin of pride, as the other sins believe. 

The news caused the rest of the sins to immediately fight over the remaining months. Pride, who had been standing dumbfounded as the other sins fought over months, rushed to explain. 

“Guys you don’t understand, the month is about LGBTQ+ Pride liking being proud of who you are, not pride as in an overconfidence in your abilities.” Seeing their confused looks he continued, “You know how some people who believe in us sins, selectively use that book to justify their hate for certain people? Well LGTBTQ+ people are one of those groups, so they have a month dedicated to being proud of who they are.”

Wrath at that moment decided to chime in “I like those people, they make a lot of people irrationally angry, which makes me happy.” The other sins looked at him weirdly, causing him to shrug. “What can I say, it’s in my nature.” The other sins shrugged too, they were all a little messed up, they were called the Seven Deadly Sins after all.
