In true Joe Biden fashion, the presumptive democratic nominee verbally slipped during a virtual town hall and confessed to a decades old double murder. When asked about his proposals to increase infrastructure spending, the gaffe-prone Biden instead offered a tearful confession to a cold case that had puzzled authorities for decades, saying,

“You know? I just can’t do this anymore. I’ve been living a lie. Forty years ago today, I killed two bikers in the parking lot of a roadside bar. The confrontation started when one of the bikers dinged my Thunderbird with his motorcycle. Now I’m not proud to admit this, but at the time I was smoking on the weed and didn’t know what I’d done until it was over.”

“Well that’s just Joe being Joe, we're all used to his gaffes by now and I don’t think this one is any different,” said Sam Stanton, a resident of West Virginia. Other voters praised Joe’s down to earth candor and authenticity. 

“I mean sometimes people just get a little confused and something slips out, we can’t hold that against him,” said Elizabeth Draper, a prospective voter from Florida.

At press time, Joe Biden’s poll numbers had remained unchanged.
