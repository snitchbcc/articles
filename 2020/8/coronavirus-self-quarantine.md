The coronavirus has just announced that it will be going into self quarantine after contact with GOP congressman Louie Gohmert on July 29th. Although a timeline has not been established, the Coronavirus is thought to have been exposed at a congressional meeting where Gohmert was present. The Coronavirus has stated that it was trying to maintain social distancing guidelines when a mask-less Gohmert shook its hand, praised it for its amazing job in highlighting government overreach, and introduced it to his friends and staffers.

Since the exposure the Coronavirus has been following all social distancing guidelines to stop the spread of what CDC scientists are calling “bullshit”. The Coronavirus has released the following statement:
	
“My self quarantine is just a precaution. I’m just being responsible. I don’t think my exposure has rendered me contagious but I cannot risk the safety of my elderly father, the Spanish flu. My heart goes out to everyone around the world who has been affected by this particularly virulent strain of stupidity.”
