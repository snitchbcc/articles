A study released Friday by Fälschung University, in Frankfurt, has found conclusive evidence that you, the person who is currently reading this article, has the best taste in music in the entire world, and that everything that every other person considers to be any good is complete and utter garbage.  

  

Dr. Narzissmus, Head Researcher and part of Fälschung’s renowned Musicology Department, has released a statement saying: “After years of study we have finally found that the only person with a valid taste in music is you, and that the music that you enjoy is now scientifically proven to be objectively better than the music that anyone else has ever listened to or tried to force you to listen to.”  

  

We at the Snitch are happy to report this news and encourage you to use this article to prove your objectively better taste next time someone tries to subject you to the pompous drivel that they consider to be art.
