The MCPD has released a statement about last week’s controversy where several members of the local mafia were let go without charges after their arrest last month:

“During the course of our investigation, we discovered that the mafia is just a front for the popular local pizza joint ‘Pizzageddon.’ Therefore, there was no basis for conviction.”

The Snitch sent Managing Editor Caleb Levy to investigate. After working his way through the underworld and accidentally selling his kidney, Caleb was able to get a phone call with the rumored leader of the Pizzageddon franchise, Chad Gasburn. Gasburn confirmed that the mafia existed solely as a front for Pizzageddon. “We figured that the pizza business would be a lot easier if we pretended to be the mafia. No one would mess with us, and we would always get the best ingredient prices.” When asked what the future of Pizzageddon was now that their cover had been blown, Gasburn was noncommittal.

Caleb at this point made a hasty retreat. As of now, no official move has been made. We can only hope to find out similar information about the local “Money Laundromat.”
