Bellatrix Estrella, a senior at B-CC, was reportedly lounging around in her bed and watching Netflix when her dad Greg invoked Stephen of Cloyes, the twelve-year-old famous for leading a crusade to reclaim the Holy Land, in hopes of rousing his daughter into action.

We interviewed Bellatrix about the Cloyes invocation and she seemed resigned about the whole incident: “He is always doing these things trying to get me to do more in life. I accept that I’m not going to live up to a guy leading a crusade at twelve, it just annoys me that it’s him of all people criticizing me. I mean people his age are winning Nobel Peace Prizes, winning Oscars, Grammys Tonys. Some are even *working*.”

The last part was yelled up the stairs of her house, where her dad presumably was. We decided the sound of something breaking in that room was our cue to leave.

If you want to help Bellatrix reclaim the Holy Land and live up to the standard set by Stephen of Cloyes, follow us on Instagram at @snitchbcc. It may not seem like it’s actively helping her but trust us it is.
