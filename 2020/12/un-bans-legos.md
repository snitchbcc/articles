In a hearing yesterday, the UN controversially removed Legos from the list of weapons banned in modern warfare, prompting criticism from everyone who has had kids in the last 30 years.

While marketed as a childrenâ€™s toy, Legos are also notorious for the damage they are capable of causing to an unprotected foot. Human rights groups across the world have protested the decision claiming that the pain Legos are capable of causing is comparable to being forced to watch teachers struggle with the most basic technology.

There have already been reports of several militaries across the world planning on how best use the newly legal weapons. Reported ideas include shrapnel in various explosives, as well as being used in the place of barbed wire in combat zones.
