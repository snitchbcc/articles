Hoping desperately that someone would come to his aid in stopping such an obvious theft, area man Gunter Clemens was reportedly bewildered as to why everyone on the street was ignoring his screams of “Stop the steal!” as a thief ran off with his television. 

“I mean, it was pretty disturbing,” Clemens told us in an interview after the incident. “There I was, on the street yelling for help, and everyone was just ignoring me. People were rolling their eyes and calling me an ass under their breath. I saw one woman take her kid and actually cover his ears. All while that bastard was getting away with my new television set. For the life of me, I can’t understand what I was doing wrong. What does it say about the state of our society when no one comes to the aid of a man so obviously screaming for help?”

At press time, Clemens was again eliciting some serious side-eye from passers-by when he shouted “Build the wall!” as an encouragement to some construction workers who were working on a new development project in his neighborhood.
