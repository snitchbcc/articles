Late yesterday, it was confirmed that over five million independent existential crises and intense soul crushing realizations of mortality were successfully crushed by the hurried consumption of an entire package of Little Debbie's Swiss Rolls™.

Although the crises were brought on by a variety of issues, like the death of a beloved pet or popular celebrity, finishing a good TV show and realizing the characters are gone forever, or just sitting around, the solution was the same for every single crisis: stuffing an entire box of sponge cakes filled with spiraling whipped cream into one’s gullet while sobbing about the futility of life, how nothing we ever do will amount to anything, and how one day the sun will expand and consume the Earth wiping out all traces of humanity from the cosmos. 

Though the statistics are not clear, it is believed that over 90% of the sales of Swiss Rolls, HoHos, and various other snack cakes can be attributed to people suffering from a profound realization that one day they will no longer walk the earth. The American Psychological Association recommends that every person have a box of snack cakes in the house at all times, and to stock up with two or more before watching the news.
