After an exhaustive investigation, *The Snitch* has uncovered definitive evidence that immature sophomore William Verne’s behavior is based on the fact that he was never released from a first grade time out. This discovery, found after *Snitch* reporters ransacked Verne’s first grade teacher’s house (for an unrelated reason), has aided in providing an explanation for Verne’s exceedingly annoying and childish behavior. 

“Oh yeah, that makes total sense!” said Patricia Wendig, a friend of Verne’s since the first grade, “I remember the day it happened. It was right before summer break and he got in trouble for pulling Sally Watterson’s hair and the teacher put him in time out. I guess he just never timed back in.”

Other characteristics that can be attributed to Verne’s extended time out are his juvenile insults, giggling throughout health class, loud and raucous attention seeking behavior, and complete lack of empathy. 

On further inquiry, it seems that Verne’s predicament is much more widespread than originally thought, with the majority of the freshman and sophomore classes showing characteristics of being stuck somewhere between the first and fifth grade.
