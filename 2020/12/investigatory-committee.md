In a hearing held yesterday, an investigatory committee of older brothers demanded to know why you’re hitting yourself. This new line of questioning, a significant departure from the committee’s last line, “Hey what's that? Ha gotcha! Now I get to punch you in the arm,” is believed to have originated from senior committee member Tyler Murphy.

Tyler released the following statement:

“We believe that it is in the best interest for this committee to now pursue this investigation into why you’re hitting yourself in the face over and over. This question may be difficult to get to the bottom of as it must be pretty difficult to talk when your fist is somehow being jammed into your mouth.”

*The Snitch* managed to obtain a transcript of the most recent committee meeting:

**SR. COMMITTEE MBR TYLER:** Why are you hitting yourself? 

**JR. COMMITTEE MBR TOM:** Why are you hitting yourself? 

**SR. COMMITTEE MBR DOUGLAS:** Why are you hitting yourself?

At press time, an oversight committee of parents had subpoenaed Tyler, Tom, and Douglas and was preparing to launch a probe into “who started this.”
