series: Letters To The Editor
---

Today we’re unveiling our third entry in the *Snitch* series **Letters To The Editor**! Since the beginning of time, we’ve been providing you with high quality news and humor. But what is our average reader like? We’ve sifted through our metric ton of fan mail to find the best, funniest, and most enlightening letters we have received and are starting to publish them here. So if you’ve got any questions, comments, concerns, or gaping holes in your soul that can only be filled by writing us letters, then this series is for you!

**Letter From Anonymous:**

Hi! I’m a huge fan of *The Snitch* and I know you’ve got a lot to do so I’ll make this short. I have your Managing Editor, Caleb Levy. Send five thousand dollars to this mailbox (<span style="background-color: currentColor;">oh so you're a smart guy eh?</span>) if you ever want to see him again. Don’t go to the police or the only way you’ll find him is in ten different trash cans that form a smiley face when marked on a map, or something like that. I want you to know that I’m serious about getting that money, so every day that I don’t get the money, I will read Caleb a section of my screenplay and also cut off one of his fingers.

**Snitch Response:**

Hey! It’s great to see our readers care enough to interact with *Snitch* staff members! Have you joined our Discord? It’s the one of the best ways to follow the *Snitch*’s progress and chat with staff members. Also, we want to say that we think it’s really cool that your parents named you Anonymous - what an awesome name! Anyway, when we skimmed your letter we noticed that you mentioned our Managing Editor, Caleb Levy. We’ve forwarded him your letter so he can give it a deeper read and send you a lengthier response. He’s been out the past couple days but when he gets back it’ll be the first thing on his agenda.
