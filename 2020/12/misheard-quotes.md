**Julius Caesar**
**Misheard Quote- The Ides Of March**
**Real Quote - The Brides Of March**
We’ve all heard of the warning that Julius Caesar was given before his infamous death in 44 B.C.E. However, the true warning has sadly been lost. The real thing Caesar was told to be wary of was brides. Later that day he returned to his house and realized he had forgotten to take out the trash. Needless to say he slept on the couch that night.

**Teddy Roosevelt**
**Misheard Quote - Speak Softly And Carry A Big Stick**
**Real Quote - Speak Softly And Carry A Big Brick**
Why would someone want to use a stick to threaten smaller, poorer countries when you can use a brick. A brick is much more effective at persuading people, and Teddy loved “persuading people.”

**Mahatma Gandhi**
**Misheard Quote - An Ounce Of Practice Is Worth A Thousand Words**
**Real Quote - An Ounce Of Practice Is Worth A Thousand Swords**
While Gandhi was often portrayed as a pacifist who inspired many, including Martin Luther King Jr., to lead peaceful lives, the man was also a master swordsman. One day while training a particularly excitable student, Gandhi took the young man’s sword and said the inspiring words. The young man’s name was Jehan Buhan, who went on to win gold in Olympic Fencing after Gandhi’s death.

**Abe Lincoln**
**Incomplete Quote - No Man Has Good Enough Memory To Be A Successful Liar**
**Full Quote - No Man Has Good Enough Memory To Be A Successful Liar Except My Crazy Ex**
In the quest to portray Abe Lincoln in the best possible light, many historians leave out the second part of this quote. At the time Lincoln was locked in a legal battle with an ex, who demanded half of his hat collection. From his wording, we can only assume that the battle was not really going in Mr. Lincoln’s favor.

**Confucius**
**Misheard Quote - Life Is Really Simple, But We Insist On Making It Hard**
**Real Quote - Life Is Really Simple, But My Mother-In-Law Insists On Making It Hard**
Many people have bad experiences with their mother-in-laws. We can only assume that once people started listening to Confucius a little bit more, he had the quote written down differently in order to sound more wise.

**Michelle Obama**
**Incomplete Quote -** **Success Is Only Meaningful And Enjoyable If It Feels Like Your Own**
**Full Quote -** **Success Is Only Meaningful And Enjoyable If It Feels Like Your Own, Regina** 
We can only assume that Obama, like many, was forced to carry a group project while her lazy group member was able to coast to a good grade. If only the last name was recorded so that this slacker could be suitably embarrassed.
